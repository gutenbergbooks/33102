<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Among the many catalogs of museum collections, few describe objects
related to the practice of medicine. This catalog is the first of a series
on the medical sciences collections in the National Museum of History and
Technology (NMHT). Bloodletting objects vary from ancient sharp-edged
instruments to the spring action and automatic devices of the last few
centuries. These instruments were used in a variety of treatments
supporting many theories of disease and therefore reflect many varied
aspects of the history of medicine. Beginning with an essay sketching the
long history of bloodletting, this catalog provides a survey of the
various kinds of instruments, both natural and man-made, that have been
used throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to thank the Smithsonian Research Foundation, the
Commonwealth Foundation, and the Houston Endowment for their financial
support of this project.</p>

<p>Miss Doris Leckie, who did much of the preliminary research and organized
part of the collection that led to a draft of this catalog with special
emphasis on the cupping apparatus, receives our highest gratitude. Her
public lectures on the topic drew much praise. The usefulness of this
catalog is due in no small part to her devoted efforts.</p>

<p>For photographing the Smithsonian objects so well we thank Richard
Hofmeister, John Wooten, and Alfred Harrell of the Smithsonian Office of
Printing and Photographic Services. For analyzing selected objects and
answering our requests promptly we thank Dr. Robert Organ, chief; Barbara
Miller, conservation director; and Martha Goodway, metallurgist, of the
Conservation Analytical Laboratory.</p>

<p>To those who helped us to solve specific problems we extend appreciation
to Dr. Arthur Nunes; Dr. Uta C. Merzbach, curator of mathematics, NMHT
(especially for finding the poem by Dr. Snodgrass); and Silvio Bedini,
deputy director, NMHT, whose enthusiasm and unmatched ability for studying
objects has sustained us throughout the period of preparation.</p>

<p>While it is traditional to add a reminder that various unnamed people
contributed to a publication, it is imperative to state here that numerous
people are essential to the collection, conservation, preservation, and
exhibition of museum objects. Without them no collection would survive and
be made available to those who come to study, admire or just enjoy these
objects. We hope this catalog brings out some of the joy as well as the
difficulties of maintaining a national historical medical collection.</p>

<h2>BLOODLETTING INSTRUMENTS</h2>
<h3>IN THE</h3>
<h3>NATIONAL MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>AUDREY DAVIS and TOBY APPEL<span class="foot"><a name="fa.1" id="fa.1" href="#fa">[A]</a></span></h3>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Bloodletting, the removal of blood from the body, has been practiced in
some form by almost all societies and cultures. At various times,
bloodletting was considered part of the medical treatment for nearly every
ailment known to man. It was also performed as punishment or as a form of
worship to a Superior Power or Being. It still retains therapeutic value
today, although only for an extremely limited range of conditions. In
early attempts to extract blood from the body, the skin was penetrated in
various places with a sharp instrument made of stone, wood, metal,
bristle, or any other rigid material. When it was recognized that a vein
visible on the surface of the skin as a blue-green stripe contained blood,
the vein was incised directly. To facilitate &#8220;breathing a vein&#8221; and to
provide greater safety, more refined and sharper instruments were devised.
As theories supporting bloodletting grew more complex, so too did the
instruments.</p>

<p>Spontaneous forms of bleeding, including nosebleed, menstruation, and
those instances produced by a blow to any part of the body, apparently
inspired the earliest human bloodletters. The Egyptians claimed that the
hippopotamus rubbed its leg against a sharp reed until it bled to remove
excess blood from its body.<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> The Peruvians noted that a bat would take
blood from the toe of a sleeping person when the opportunity presented
itself. A deer, and goat, would pick a place near its diseased eye for
relief.<small><a name="f2.1" id="f2.1" href="#f2">[2]</a></small> The methods employed by animals increased interest in using
artificial methods for letting blood in man.</p>

<p>The devices man has employed to remove blood from the body fall into two
major categories: (1) those instruments used for general bloodletting,
that is, the opening of an artery, or more commonly a vein, and (2) those
instruments used in local bloodletting. Instruments in the first category
include lancets, spring lancets, fleams, and phlebotomes. Associated with
these are the containers to collect and measure the blood spurting from
the patient. In the second category are those instruments associated with
leeching and cupping. In both of these methods of local bloodletting, only
the capillaries are severed and the blood is drawn from the body by some
means of suction, either by a leech or by an air exhausted vessel.
Instruments in this category include scarificators, cupping glasses,
cupping devices, and many artificial leeches invented to replace the
living leech.</p>

<p>Much effort and ingenuity was expanded, especially in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, to improve the techniques of bloodletting. In the
eighteenth century, delicate mechanical spring lancets and scarificators
were invented to replace the simpler thumb lancets and fleams. In the
nineteenth century, as surgical supply companies began to advertise and
market their wares, many enterprising inventors turned their hand to
developing new designs for lancets and scarificators, pumps, fancy cupping
sets, rubber cups, and all manner of cupping devices and artificial
leeches. If we also consider treatments related to bloodletting, in which
blood is transferred from one part of the body to another, without actual
removal from the body, then we can add the many inventions devoted to dry
cupping, irritating the body, and exhausting the air around limbs or even
the entire body. Although many physicians continued to use the traditional
instruments that had been used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> centuries, many others turned eagerly
to the latest gadget on the market.</p>

<p>Bloodletting instruments, perhaps the most common type of surgical
instrument little more than a century ago, are now unfamiliar to the
average person. When one sees them for the first time, one is often amazed
at their petite size, careful construction, beautiful materials, and
elegant design. One marvels at spring lancets made of silver, thumb
lancets with delicate tortoise shell handles, and sets of hand-blown cups
in the compartments of a mahogany container with brass and ivory latches
and a red plush lining. Those finding such instruments in their attic or
in a collection of antiques, even if they can determine that the
instruments were used for bloodletting, often have no idea when the
instruments were made or how they were used. Frequently a veterinary
spring lancet or fleam is mistaken for a human lancet, or a <ins class="correction" title="original: sacrificator">scarificator</ins>
for an instrument of venesection. Almost nothing has been written to
describe these once common instruments and to place them in historical
context. Historians who study the history of medical theory usually ignore
medical practice, and they rarely make reference to the material means by
which a medical diagnosis or treatment was carried out. It is hoped that
this publication will fill a need for a general history of these
instruments. This history is pieced together from old textbooks of
surgery, medical encyclopedias, compilations of surgical instruments,
trade catalogs, and the instruments themselves.</p>

<p>The collection of instruments at the National Museum of History and
Technology of the Smithsonian Institution contains several hundred pieces
representing most of the major types of instruments. Begun in the late
nineteenth century when medical sciences were still part of the Department
of Anthropology, the collection has grown steadily through donations and
purchases. As might be expected, it is richest in bloodletting instruments
manufactured in America in the nineteenth century. One of its earliest
acquisitions was a set of four flint lancets used by Alaskan natives in
the 1880s. A major source for nineteenth-century instruments is the
collection of instruments used by the members of the Medical and
Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland, a medical society founded in 1799. The
Smithsonian collection also includes patent models of bloodletting
instruments submitted to the U.S. Patent Office by nineteenth-century
inventors and transferred to the Smithsonian in 1926.</p>

<p>Because we have made an effort to survey every major type of instrument
related to bloodletting, it is hoped that this publication will serve as a
general introduction to bloodletting instruments, and not merely a guide
to the Smithsonian collection. With this goal in mind, the catalog of
bloodletting instruments has been preceded by chapters surveying the
history of bloodletting and describing, in general terms, the procedures
and instruments that have been used since antiquity for venesection,
cupping, leeching, and veterinary bloodletting. In the course of our
research we have consulted several other collections of bloodletting
instruments, notably the collections of the Wellcome Museum of London, the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the College of Physicians in
Philadelphia, the Institute of the History of Medicine at the Johns
Hopkins University, the Howard Dittrick Medical Museum in Cleveland, and
the University of Toronto. Illustrations from these collections and
references to them have been included in the cases where the Smithsonian
collection lacks a particular type of instrument.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>While primary sources describing the procedures and presenting theoretical
arguments for and against bloodletting are plentiful, descriptions of the
instruments and their manufacture are often difficult to find. Before the
nineteenth century, one may find illustrations of bloodletting instruments
in the major textbooks on surgery, in encyclopedias such as that of
Diderot, and in compendia of surgical instruments written by surgeons. The
descriptions following the drawings are often meager and give little
indication of where, when, and how the instruments were produced. Until
well into the nineteenth century, the tools used by barber-surgeons,
surgeons, and dentists were made by blacksmiths, silversmiths, and
cutlers. These craftsmen generally left little record of their work. As
the demand for surgical instruments increased, specialized surgical
instrument makers began to appear, and the cutler began to advertise
himself as &#8220;Cutler and Surgical Instrument Maker&#8221; rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> than simply
&#8220;Cutler and Scissor Grinder.&#8221; A few advertising cards dating from the
eighteenth century may be found, but the illustrated trade catalog is a
product of the nineteenth century. Among the earliest compendia/catalogs
of surgical instruments written by an instrument maker, rather than by a
surgeon, was John Savigny&#8217;s <i>A Collection of Engravings Representing the
Most Modern and Approved Instruments Used in the Practice of Surgery</i>
(London, 1799). This was followed a few decades later by the brochures and
catalog (1831) of the famous London instrument maker, John Weiss. By the
1840s John Weiss, Charri&egrave;re of Paris, and a few other instrument makers
had begun to form surgical supply companies that attempted to market
instruments over a wide area. While there are a handful of company trade
catalogs dating from the 1840s, 1850s, and 1860s, the great influx of such
catalogs came after 1870. Trade catalogs, a major source of information on
the new instruments of the nineteenth century, provide the historian with
line drawings, short descriptions indicating the mechanism and the
material of which the instrument was composed, prices, and patent status.
For more details on nineteenth-century instruments one must turn to
brochures and articles in medical journals introducing the instruments to
the medical profession. These sources provide the most detailed
descriptions of how the instruments were constructed, how they were used,
and why they were invented. For many American instruments, the
descriptions available at the U.S. Patent Office offer illustrations of
the mechanism and a discussion of why the instrument was considered novel.
One finds specifications for many bizarre instruments that never appear in
trade catalogs and may never have been actually sold.</p>

<p>A final source of information is the instruments themselves. Some are
engraved with the name of the manufacturer, and a few are even engraved
with the date of manufacture. Some have been taken apart to study the
spring mechanisms and others examined in the Conservation Analytical
Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution to determine their material
content. The documentation accompanying the instruments, while sometimes
in error, may serve to identify the individual artifact by name, place and
date of manufacture, and to augment our knowledge of the historical
setting in which these instruments were used.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bleeding: The History</h3>

<p>The history of bloodletting has been marked by controversy. The extensive
literature on bloodletting contains numerous polemical treatises that both
extol and condemn the practice. Bloodletting was no sooner criticized as
ineffective and dangerous than it was rescued from complete abandonment by
a new group of zealous supporters.</p>

<p>From the time of Hippocrates (5th century <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>)&mdash;and probably before,
although no written record is available&mdash;bloodletting had its vocal
advocates and heated opponents. In the 5th century <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span> Aegimious of Eris
(470 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>), author of the first treatise on the pulse, opposed
venesection, while Diogenes of Appolonia (430 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>), who described the
vena cava with its main branches, was a proponent of the practice.
Hippocrates, to whom no specific text on bloodletting is attributed, both
approved and recommended venesection.<small><a name="f3.1" id="f3.1" href="#f3">[3]</a></small></p>

<p>The anatomist and physician Erasistratus (300-260 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>), was one of the
earliest physicians to leave a record of why he opposed venesection, the
letting of blood from a vein. Erasistratus, who practiced at the court of
the King of Syria and later at Alexandria, a celebrated center of ancient
medicine, recognized that the difficulty in estimating the amount of blood
to be withdrawn and the possibility of mistakenly cutting an artery,
tendon, or nerve might cause permanent damage or even death. Since
Erasistratus believed that only the veins carried blood while the arteries
contained air, he also feared the possibility of transferring air from the
arteries into the veins as a result of venesection. Erasistratus was led
to question how excessive venesection differed from committing murder.<small><a name="f4.1" id="f4.1" href="#f4">[4]</a></small></p>

<p>Through the writings of Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>-?), the Roman
encyclopedist, and Galen (ca. <span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span> 130-200) venesection was restored as a
form of orthodox medical treatment and remained so for the next fifteen
hundred years. By the time of Celsus, bloodletting had become a common
treatment. Celsus remarked in his well-known account of early medicine:
&#8220;To let blood by incising a vein is no novelty; what is novel is that
there should be scarcely any malady in which blood may not be let.&#8221;<small><a name="f5.1" id="f5.1" href="#f5">[5]</a></small> Yet
criticism of bloodletting continued, for when Galen went to Rome in <span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span>
164 he found the followers of Erasistratus opposing venesection. Galen
opened up discussion with these physicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> in two books, <i>Against
Erasistratus</i> and <i>Against the Erasistrateans Dwelling in Rome</i>. These
argumentative dialectical treatises, together with his <i>Therapeutics of
Venesection</i>, in which he presented his theory and practice of
venesection, established Galen&#8217;s views on bloodletting, which were not
effectively challenged until the seventeenth century.<small><a name="f6.1" id="f6.1" href="#f6">[6]</a></small></p>

<p>The fundamental theory upon which explanations of health and disease were
based, which had its inception in ancient Greek thought and lasted up to
the eighteenth century, was the humoral theory. Based on the scientific
thought of the Pre-Socratics, the Pythagoreans, and the Sicilians, this
theory posited that when the humors, consisting of blood, phlegm, yellow
bile, and black bile, were in balance within the body, good health ensued.
Conversely, when one or more of these humors was overabundant or in less
than adequate supply, disease resulted. The humors were paired off with
specific qualities representing each season of the year and the four
elements according to the well-accepted doctrine of Empedocles, in which
all things were composed of earth, air, fire, and water. Thus, yellow
bile, fire, and summer were contrasted to phlegm, water, and winter, while
blood, air, and spring were contrasted to black bile, earth, and autumn.
When arranged diagrammatically, the system incorporating the humors,
elements, seasons, and qualities appears as shown in Figure <a href="#fig1">1</a>. The
earliest formulation of humoralism was to be found in the physiological
and pathological theory of the Hippocratic treatise, <i>On the Nature of
Man</i>.<small><a name="f7.1" id="f7.1" href="#f7">[7]</a></small></p>

<p>Plethora, an overabundance of body humors, including blood, which
characterized fevers and inflammations, was properly treated by
encouraging evacuation. This could be done through drugs that purged or
brought on vomiting, by starvation, or by letting blood. During starvation
the veins became empty of food and then readily absorbed blood that
escaped into the arteries. As this occurred, inflammation decreased. Galen
suggested that instead of starvation, which required some time and
evacuated the system with much discomfort to the patient, venesection
should be substituted to remove the blood directly.<small><a name="f8.1" id="f8.1" href="#f8">[8]</a></small></p>

<p>Peter Niebyl, who has traced the rationale for bloodletting from the time
of Hippocrates to the seventeenth century, concluded that bloodletting was
practiced more to remove excess good blood rather than to eliminate
inherently bad blood or foreign matter. Generally, venesection was
regarded as an equivalent to a reduction of food, since according to
ancient physiological theory, food was converted to blood.<small><a name="f9.1" id="f9.1" href="#f9">[9]</a></small></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Chart of elements, seasons, and humors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Galen defined the criteria for bloodletting in terms of extent, intensity,
and severity of the disease, whether the disease was &#8220;incipient,&#8221;
&#8220;present,&#8221; or &#8220;prospective,&#8221; and on the maturity and strength of the
patient.<small><a name="f10.1" id="f10.1" href="#f10">[10]</a></small> Only a skilled physician would thus know when it was proper
to bleed a patient. Venesection could be extremely dangerous if not
correctly administered, but in the hands of a good physician, venesection
was regarded by Galen as a more accurate treatment than drugs. While one
could measure with great accuracy the dosages of such drugs as emetics,
diuretics, and purgatives, Galen argued that their action on the body was
directed by chance and could not easily be observed by the physician.<small><a name="f11.1" id="f11.1" href="#f11">[11]</a></small>
However, the effects of bloodletting were readily observed. One could note
the change in the color of the blood removed, the complexion of the
patient, and the point at which the patient was about to become
unconscious, and know precisely when to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Galen discussed in great detail the selection of veins to open and the
number of times blood might be withdrawn.<small><a name="f12.1" id="f12.1" href="#f12">[12]</a></small> In choosing the vein to
open, its location in respect to the disease was important. Galen
recommended that bleeding be done from a blood vessel on the same side of
the body as the disease. For example, he explained that blood from the
right elbow be removed to stop a nosebleed from the right nostril.<small><a name="f13.1" id="f13.1" href="#f13">[13]</a></small>
Celsus had argued for withdrawing blood near the site of the disease for
&#8220;bloodletting draws blood out of the nearest place first, and thereupon
blood from more distant parts follows so long as the letting out of blood
is continued.&#8221;<small><a name="f14.1" id="f14.1" href="#f14">[14]</a></small></p>

<p>Controversy over the location of the veins to be opened erupted in the
sixteenth century. Many publications appeared arguing the positive and
negative aspects of bleeding from a vein on the same side
(derivative&mdash;from the Latin <i>derivatio</i> from the verb <i>derivare</i>, &#8220;to draw
away,&#8221; &#8220;to divert&#8221;) or the opposite side (revulsion&mdash;from the Latin
<i>revulsio</i>, &#8220;drawing in a contrary direction&#8221;) of the disordered part of
the body. This debate mirrored a broader struggle over whether to practice
medicine on principles growing out of medieval medical views or out of
classical Greek doctrines that had recently been revived and brought into
prominence. The medieval practice was based on the Moslem medical writers
who emphasized revulsion (bleeding from a site located as far from the
ailment as possible).<small><a name="f15.1" id="f15.1" href="#f15">[15]</a></small> This position was attacked in 1514 by Pierre
Brissot (1478-1522), a Paris physician, who stressed the importance of
bleeding near the locus of the disease (derivative bleeding). He was
declared a medical heretic by the Paris Faculty of Medicine and derivative
bleeding was forbidden by an act of the French parliament. In 1518,
Brissot was exiled to Spain and Portugal. In 1539, the celebrated
anatomist, Andreas Vesalius, continued the controversy with his famous
<i>Venesection Letter</i>, which came to the support of Brissot.<small><a name="f16.1" id="f16.1" href="#f16">[16]</a></small></p>

<p>Only with the gradual awareness of the implications of the circulation of
the blood (discovered in 1628) did discussion of the distinction between
derivative and revulsive bloodletting become pass&eacute;.<small><a name="f17.1" id="f17.1" href="#f17">[17]</a></small> Long after the
circulation of the blood was established, surgical treatises such as those
of Lorenz Heister (1719) recommended removing blood from specific parts of
the body&mdash;such as particular veins in the arm, hand, foot, forehead,
temples, inner corners of the eye, neck, and under the tongue. In the
nineteenth century this practice was still challenged in the literature as
a meaningless procedure.<small><a name="f18.1" id="f18.1" href="#f18">[18]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig2">2</a>.)</p>


<p><br /><i>How Much Blood to Take</i></p>

<p>According to Galen, safety dictated that the first bloodletting be kept to
a minimum, if possible. Second, third, or further bleedings could be taken
if the condition and the patient&#8217;s progress seemed to indicate they would
be of value. The amount of blood to be taken at one time varied
widely.<small><a name="f19.1" id="f19.1" href="#f19">[19]</a></small></p>

<p>Galen appears to have been the first to note the amount of blood that
could be withdrawn: the greatest quantity he mentions is one pound and a
half and the smallest is seven ounces. Avicenna (980-1037) believed that
ordinarily there were 25 pounds of blood in a man and that a man could
bleed at the nose 20 pounds and not die.<small><a name="f20.1" id="f20.1" href="#f20">[20]</a></small></p>

<p>The standard advice to bloodletters, especially in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, was &#8220;bleed to syncope.&#8221; &#8220;Generally speaking,&#8221; wrote
the English physician and medical researcher, Marshall Hall, in 1836, &#8220;as
long as bloodletting is required, it can be borne; and as long as it can
be borne, it is required.&#8221;<small><a name="f21.1" id="f21.1" href="#f21">[21]</a></small> The American physician, Robley Dunglison,
defined &#8220;syncope&#8221; in his 1848 medical dictionary as a &#8220;complete and,
commonly, sudden loss of sensation and motion, with considerable
diminution, or entire suspension of the pulsations of the heart and the
respiratory movements.&#8221;<small><a name="f22.1" id="f22.1" href="#f22">[22]</a></small> Today little distinction is made between shock
and collapse, or syncope, except to recognize that if collapse or syncope
persists, shock will result.</p>

<p>We know today that blood volume is about one-fifteenth to one-seventeenth
the body weight of an adult. Thus an adult weighing 150 pounds has 9 or 10
pounds of blood in his body. Blood volume may increase at great heights,
under tropical conditions, and in the rare disease polycythemia (excess
red blood cells). After a pint of blood is withdrawn from a healthy
individual, the organism replaces it to some degree within an hour or so.
However, it takes weeks for the hemoglobin (the oxygen-bearing substance
in the red blood cells) to be brought up to normal.</p>

<p>If blood loss is great (more than 10 percent of the total blood volume)
there occurs a sudden, systemic fall in blood pressure. This is a
well-known protective mechanism to aid blood clotting. If the volume of
blood lost does not exceed 30 to 40 percent, systolic, disastolic, and
pulse pressures rise again after approximately 30 minutes as a result of
various compensatory mechanisms.<small><a name="f23.1" id="f23.1" href="#f23">[23]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>If larger volumes than this are removed, the organism is usually unable to
survive unless the loss is promptly replaced. Repeated smaller bleedings
may produce a state of chronic anemia when the total amount of blood and
hemoglobin removed is in excess of the natural recuperative powers.</p>


<p><br /><i>When to Bleed</i></p>

<p>Selecting a time for bleeding usually depended on the nature of the
disease and the patient&#8217;s ability to withstand the process. Galen&#8217;s
scheme, in contrast to the Hippocratic doctrine, recommended no specific
days.<small><a name="f24.1" id="f24.1" href="#f24">[24]</a></small> Hippocrates worked out an elaborate schedule, based on the onset
and type of disease, to which the physician was instructed to adhere
regardless of the patient&#8217;s condition.</p>

<p>Natural events outside the body served as indicators for selecting the
time, site, and frequency of bloodletting during the Middle Ages when
astrological influences dominated diagnostic and therapeutic thought. This
is illustrated by the fact that the earliest printed document relating to
medicine was the &#8220;Calendar for Bloodletting&#8221; issued in Mainz in 1457. This
type of calendar, also used for purgation, was known as an
<i>Aderlasskalender</i>, and was printed in other German cities such as
Augsburg, Nuremberg, Strassburg, and Leipzig. During the fifteenth century
these calendars and <i>Pestblatter</i>, or plague warnings, were the most
popular medical literature. Sir William Osler and Karl Sudhoff studied
hundreds of these calendars.<small><a name="f25.1" id="f25.1" href="#f25">[25]</a></small> They consisted of a single sheet with
some astronomical figures and a diagram of a man (<i>Aderlassmann</i>)
depicting the influence of the stars and the signs of the zodiac on each
part of the body, as well as the parts of the anatomy suitable for
bleeding. These charts illustrated the veins and arteries that should be
incised to let blood for specific ailments and usually included brief
instructions in the margin. The annotated bloodletting figure was one of
the earliest subjects of woodcuts. One early and well known <i>Aderlassmann</i>
was prepared by Johann Regiomontanus (Johannes M&uuml;ller) in 1473. It
contained a dozen proper bleeding points, each suited for use under a
sign of the zodiac. Other <i>Aderlassmanner</i> illustrated specific veins to
be bled. The woodcut produced by the sixteenth-century mathematician,
Johannes Stoeffer, illustrated 53 points where the lancet might be
inserted.<small><a name="f26.1" id="f26.1" href="#f26">[26]</a></small></p>

<p>&#8220;Medicina astrologica&#8221; exerted a great influence on bloodletting.
Determining the best time to bleed reached a high degree of perfection in
the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries with the use of volvella or
calculating devices adopted from astronomy and navigation. These were
carried on a belt worn around the waist for easy consultation. Used in
conjunction with a table and a vein-man drawing, the volvella contained
movable circular calculators for determining the accuracy, time, amount,
and site to bleed for an illness. The dangers of bloodletting elicited
both civic and national concern and control. Statutes were enacted that
required every physician to consult these tables before opening a vein to
minimize the chance of bleeding improperly and unnecessarily. Consultation
of the volvella and vein-man was more important than an examination of the
patient.<small><a name="f27.1" id="f27.1" href="#f27">[27]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig3">3</a>.)</p>

<p>For several centuries, almanacs were consulted to determine the propitious
time for bleeding. The &#8220;woodcut anatomy&#8221; became a characteristic
illustration of the colonial American almanac. John Foster introduced the
&#8220;Man of Signs,&#8221; as it was called, into the American almanac tradition in
his almanac for 1678, printed in Boston. Other examples of early American
almanacs featuring illustrations of bleeding include Daniel Leed&#8217;s almanac
for 1693, printed in Philadelphia, and John Clapp&#8217;s almanac for 1697,
printed in New York.</p>

<p>As in many of the medieval illustrations, the woodcut anatomy in the
American almanac consisted of a naked man surrounded by the twelve signs
of the zodiac, each associated with a particular part of the body (the
head and face with Aries, the neck with Taurus, the arms with Gemini,
etc.). The directions that often accompanied the figure instructed the
user to find the day of the month in the almanac chart, note the sign or
place of the moon associated with that day, and then look for the sign in
the woodcut anatomy to discover what part of the body is governed by that
sign. Bloodletting was usually not specifically mentioned, but it is
likely that some colonials still used the &#8220;Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> of Signs&#8221; or &#8220;Moon&#8217;s Man&#8221;
to determine where to open a vein on a given day.<small><a name="f28.1" id="f28.1" href="#f28">[28]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eighteenth-century family Bible might contain a list of the favorable
and unfavorable days in each month for bleeding, as in the case of the
Bible of the Degge family of Virginia.<small><a name="f29.1" id="f29.1" href="#f29">[29]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>Barber-Surgeons</i></p>

<p>Even though it was recognized that bleeding was a delicate operation that
could be fatal if not done properly, it was, from the medieval period on,
often left in the hands of the barber-surgeons, charlatans, and women
healers. In the early Middle Ages the barber-surgeons flourished as their
services grew in demand. Barber-surgeons had additional opportunities to
practice medicine after priests were instructed to abandon the practice of
medicine and concentrate on their religious duties. Clerics were cautioned
repeatedly by Pope Innocent II through the Council at Rheims in 1131, the
Lateran Council in 1139, and five subsequent councils, not to devote time
to duties related to the body if they must neglect matters related to the
soul.<small><a name="f30.1" id="f30.1" href="#f30">[30]</a></small></p>

<p>By 1210, the barber-surgeons in England had gathered together and formed a
Guild of Barber-Surgeons whose members were divided into Surgeons of the
Long Robe and Lay-Barbers or Surgeons of the Short Robe. The latter were
gradually forbidden by law to do any surgery except bloodletting, wound
surgery, cupping, leeching, shaving, extraction of teeth, and giving
enemas.<small><a name="f31.1" id="f31.1" href="#f31">[31]</a></small> The major operations were in the hands of specialists, often
hereditary in certain families, who, if they were members of the Guild,
would have been Surgeons of the Long Robe.</p>

<p><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Figure 4.</span>&mdash;Bleeding bowl with gradations to measure the
amount of blood. Made by John Foster of London after 1740. (Held by the
Division of Cultural History, Greenwood Collection, Smithsonian
Institution; SI photo 61166-C.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To distinguish his profession from that of a surgeon, the barber-surgeon
placed a striped pole or a signboard outside his door, from which was
suspended a basin for receiving the blood (Figure <a href="#fig4">4</a>). Cervantes used this
type of bowl as the &#8220;Helmet of Mambrino&#8221; in Don Quixote.<small><a name="f32.1" id="f32.1" href="#f32">[32]</a></small>
Special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
bowls to catch the blood from a vein were beginning to come into fashion
in the fourteenth century. They were shaped from clay or thin brass and
later were made of pewter or handsomely decorated pottery. Some pewter
bowls were graduated from 2 to 20 ounces by a series of lines incised
around the inside to indicate the number of ounces of fluid when filled to
that level. Ceramic bleeding bowls, which often doubled as shaving bowls,
usually had a semicircular indentation on one side to facilitate slipping
the bowl under the chin. Bowls to be used only for bleeding usually had a
handle on one side. Italian families had a tradition of passing special
glass bleeding vessels from generation to generation. The great variety in
style, color, and size of bleeding and shaving bowls is demonstrated by
the beautiful collection of over 500 pieces of Dr. A. Lawrence Abel of
London and by the collection of the Wellcome Historical Museum, which has
been cataloged in John Crellin&#8217;s <i>Medical Ceramics</i>.<small><a name="f33.1" id="f33.1" href="#f33">[33]</a></small> These collections
illustrate the stylistic differences between countries and periods.</p>

<p>The barber-surgeons&#8217; pole represented the stick gripped by the patient&#8217;s
hand to promote bleeding from his arm. The white stripe on the pole
corresponded to the tourniquet applied above the vein to be opened in the
arm or leg. Red or blue stripes appeared on early barber poles, but later
poles contained both colors.<small><a name="f34.1" id="f34.1" href="#f34">[34]</a></small></p>

<p>The dangers posed by untutored and unskilled bleeders were noted
periodically. In antiquity Galen complained about non-professional
bleeders, and in the Middle Ages, Lanfranc (1315), an outstanding surgeon,
lamented the tendency of surgeons of his time to abandon bloodletting to
barbers and women.<small><a name="f35.1" id="f35.1" href="#f35">[35]</a></small> Barber-surgeons continued to let blood through the
seventeenth century. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the
better educated surgeon, and sometimes even the physician, took charge of
bleeding.</p>


<p><br /><i>Bloodletting and the Scientific Revolution</i></p>

<p>The discovery of the blood&#8217;s circulation did not result in immediate
changes in the methods or forms of bloodletting. William Harvey, who
published his discovery of circulation in 1628, recognized the value of
investigating the implications of his theory. Harvey could not explain the
causes and uses of the circulation but he believed that it did not rule
out the practice of bloodletting. He claimed that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>daily experience satisfies us that bloodletting has a most salutary
effect in many diseases, and is indeed the foremost among all the
general remedial means: vitiated states and plethora of blood, are
causes of a whole host of disease; and the timely evacuation of a
certain quantity of the fluid frequently delivers patients from very
dangerous diseases, and even from imminent death.<small><a name="f36.1" id="f36.1" href="#f36">[36]</a></small></p></div>

<p>The English scientist Henry Stubbe brought to the surface what would
appear to be an obvious dilemma: How could one bleed to produce local
effect if the blood circulated? Stubbe commented in 1671:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I do say, that no experienced Physician ever denied the operation of
bloodletting though since the tenet of the Circulation of the Blood
the manner how such an effect doth succeed admits of some dispute,
and is obscure. We the silly followers of Galen and the Ancients do
think it an imbecility of judgement, for any to desert an experienced
practice, because he doth not comprehend in what manner it is
effected.<small><a name="f37.1" id="f37.1" href="#f37">[37]</a></small></p></div>

<p>In the early nineteenth century the physiologist Fran&ccedil;ois Magendie
(1783-1855), who argued against bloodletting, showed that the
physiological effects of opening different veins was exactly the same, and
therefore the choice of which vein to bleed did not affect the
procedure.<small><a name="f38.1" id="f38.1" href="#f38">[38]</a></small></p>

<p>The first serious modern challenges to bloodletting were made in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries under the leadership of the German
alchemist Paracelsus and his Belgian follower, Van Helmont. The medical
chemists or iatrochemists espoused explanations for and treatments of
diseases based on chemical theories and practices. They believed that the
state of the blood could best be regulated by administering the proper
chemicals and drugs rather than by simply removing a portion of the blood.
Iatrochemistry provided a substitution in the form of medicinals to quell
the flow of blood for therapeutic purposes.<small><a name="f39.1" id="f39.1" href="#f39">[39]</a></small></p>

<p>The revival of Hippocratic medicine in the late seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries also led to questioning the efficacy of bloodletting. The
Hippocratic treatises, while they occasionally mentioned bloodletting,
generally stressed nature&#8217;s power of cure. This school of medicine
advocated a return to clinical observation and a reduction of activist
intervention. Treatments such as bloodletting, it was felt by the
neo-Hippocratists, might merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> serve to weaken the patient&#8217;s strength
and hinder the healing processes of nature.<small><a name="f40.1" id="f40.1" href="#f40">[40]</a></small></p>

<p>A rival group of medical theorists also flourished in this period. The
iatrophysicists, who concentrated on mechanical explanations of
physiological events, remained adherents of bloodletting. Their support of
the practice ensured its use at a time when the first substantial
criticism of it arose.</p>


<p><br /><i>Instrumentation and Techniques</i></p>

<p>Sharp thorns, roots, fish teeth, and sharpened stones were among the early
implements used to let blood.<small><a name="f41.1" id="f41.1" href="#f41">[41]</a></small> Venesection, one of the most frequently
mentioned procedures in ancient medicine, and related procedures such as
lancing abcesses, puncturing cavities containing fluids, and dissecting
tissues, were all accomplished in the classical period and later with an
instrument called the phlebotome. <i>Phlebos</i> is Greek for &#8220;vein,&#8221; while
&#8220;tome&#8221; derives from <i>temnein</i>, meaning &#8220;to cut.&#8221; In Latin, &#8220;phlebotome&#8221;
becomes &#8220;flebotome,&#8221; and in an Anglo-Saxon manuscript dating from <span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span>
1000, the word &#8220;fleam&#8221; appears. The phlebotome, a type of lancet, was not
described in any of the ancient literature, but its uses make it apparent
that it was a sharp-pointed, double-edged, and straight-bladed cutting
implement or scalpel similar to the type later used for splitting larger
veins.<small><a name="f42.1" id="f42.1" href="#f42">[42]</a></small></p>

<p>Several early Roman examples of phlebotomes have been collected in
European museums. One, now in the Cologne Museum, was made of steel with a
square handle and blade of myrtle leaf shape. Another specimen, made of
bronze, was uncovered in the house of the physician of <i>Strada del
Consulare</i> of Pompeii. This specimen, now in the Naples Museum, is 8 cm
long and 9 mm at the broadest part of the blade, and its handle bears a
raised ring ornamentation.<small><a name="f43.1" id="f43.1" href="#f43">[43]</a></small> A number of copies of Roman instruments
have been made and some have passed into museum collections. Some of the
copies were commissioned by Sir Henry Wellcome for the Wellcome Historical
Medical Museum collection and the Howard Dittrick Historical Medical
Museum in Cleveland. They emulate the size, color, and aged condition of
the originals and make it very difficult for the inexpert to distinguish
an original from its replica. It is, however, impossible to fully
duplicate the patina of ancient bronze.<small><a name="f44.1" id="f44.1" href="#f44">[44]</a></small> Seventeenth-century and later
bloodletting instruments usually have not been copied.<small><a name="f45.1" id="f45.1" href="#f45">[45]</a></small></p>

<p>From the earliest examples of the fleam, such as the specimen found at
Pompeii, this instrument has been associated with the veterinarian. Since
early practitioners, particularly the Roman physician, performed the
duties of the surgeon as well as those of the veterinarian, it is possible
that they used the same instrument to open blood vessels in humans and
animals.<small><a name="f46.1" id="f46.1" href="#f46">[46]</a></small></p>

<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a type of fleam (German
<i>fliete</i>, French <i>flamette</i>), which had a pointed edge at right angles to
the handle, was in use in Germany, Holland, and Vienna, Austria.<small><a name="f47.1" id="f47.1" href="#f47">[47]</a></small> Since
the specimens found in museums vary in size, it is likely that this type
of fleam was used on both animals and humans.</p>

<p>In about the fifteenth century the thumb lancet, also called a
<i>gladiolus</i>, <i>sagitella</i>, <i>lanceola</i>, <i>lancetta</i>, or <i>olivaris</i>, was
introduced.<small><a name="f48.1" id="f48.1" href="#f48">[48]</a></small> It soon became the preferred instrument for opening a vein
in any part of the body. The double-edged iron or steel blade was placed
between two larger covers, usually made of horn or shell, and all three
pieces were united at the base with a riveted screw. The blade could be
placed at various angles of inclination when in use. The shape of the
blade, whether broad or narrow, determined the ease with which the skin
and vein could be penetrated. A long slender blade was essential to pierce
a vein located below many layers of fatty tissue.<small><a name="f49.1" id="f49.1" href="#f49">[49]</a></small> These tiny and
delicate thumb lancets were often carried in small flat cases of silver,
tortoise shell, shagreen, or leather with hinged tops and separate
compartments for each lancet. (Figure <a href="#fig5">5</a>.)</p>

<p>A surgeon was advised to carry lancets of various sizes and shapes in
order to be prepared to open veins of differing sizes and in different
locations. Even Hippocrates had cautioned bloodletters not to use the
different size lancets indiscriminately, &#8220;for there are certain parts of
the body which have a swift current of blood which it is not easy to
stop.&#8221;<small><a name="f50.1" id="f50.1" href="#f50">[50]</a></small> For vessels that bled easily, it was essential to make narrow
openings; otherwise it would be difficult, if not impossible, to stop the
flow of the blood. For other vessels, lancets that made larger openings
were required or the blood would not flow satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The blood as it spurted from the vein would be collected in a container
and measured. When enough blood was removed, the bleeding would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>be
stopped by a bandage or compress applied to the incision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teaching a medical student how to bleed has had a long tradition. Before
approaching a patient, the student practiced opening a vein quickly and
accurately on plants, especially the fruits and stems.<small><a name="f51.1" id="f51.1" href="#f51">[51]</a></small> The mark of a
good venesector was his ability not to let even a drop of blood be seen
after the bleeding basin was removed.<small><a name="f52.1" id="f52.1" href="#f52">[52]</a></small></p>

<p>It required some degree of skill to strike a vein properly. The most
common vein tapped was in the elbow, although veins in the foot were also
popular. The arm was first rubbed and the patient given a stick to grasp.
Then a tourniquet would be applied above the elbow (or, if the blood was
to be taken from the foot, above the ankle), in order to enlarge the veins
and promote a continuous flow of blood. Holding the handle between the
thumb and the first finger, the operator then jabbed the lancet into the
vein. Sometimes, especially if the vein was not close to the surface of
the skin, the instrument was given an extra impetus by striking it with a
small mallet or the fingers to insure puncturing the vein.<small><a name="f53.1" id="f53.1" href="#f53">[53]</a></small> The
incisions were made diagonally or parallel to the veins in order to
minimize the danger of cutting the vein in two.<small><a name="f54.1" id="f54.1" href="#f54">[54]</a></small></p>

<p>For superficial veins, the vein was sometimes transfixed, that is, the
blade would be inserted underneath the vessel so that the vessel could not
move or slip out of reach. The transfixing procedure ensured that the vein
would remain semi-divided so that blood would continuously pass out of it,
and that injury to other structures would be avoided. Deep-lying veins of
the scalp, for example, could not be transfixed. They were divided by
cutting through everything overlying them since there were no important
structures to injure.<small><a name="f55.1" id="f55.1" href="#f55">[55]</a></small></p>

<p>The consequences of puncturing certain veins incorrectly were discussed by
many early writers including Galen, Celsus, Antyllus, and Paul of
Aegina.<small><a name="f56.1" id="f56.1" href="#f56">[56]</a></small> Injury to a nearby nerve, muscle, or artery resulted in
convulsions, excessive bleeding, or paralysis.</p>

<p>Bloodletting was at its most fashionable in the eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. In this period it was considered an art to hold the
lancet properly and to support the arm of the patient with delicacy and
grace.<small><a name="f57.1" id="f57.1" href="#f57">[57]</a></small> Many patients had by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> repeated bloodlettings become inured to
its potential danger and unpleasantness. In the mid-eighteenth century one
British physician declared: &#8220;People are so familiarized to bleeding that
they cannot easily conceive any hurt or danger to ensue, and therefore
readily submit, when constitutional fear is out of the question, to the
opening of a vein, however unskillfully advised.&#8221;<small><a name="f58.1" id="f58.1" href="#f58">[58]</a></small> In England in the
early nineteenth century people came to the hospital to be bled in the
spring and fall as part of the ritual for maintaining good health. At some
periods there were so many people undergoing prophylactic bloodletting
that they could be seen lying on the floor of the hospital while
recovering from the faintness induced by venesection.<small><a name="f59.1" id="f59.1" href="#f59">[59]</a></small></p>

<p>The lancet was perhaps the most common medical instrument. <i>The Lancet</i>
was the name of one of the oldest and most socially aware English medical
journals, founded by Thomas Wakeley in 1823.<small><a name="f60.1" id="f60.1" href="#f60">[60]</a></small></p>

<p>In America, Benjamin Rush (1746-1813) promoted vomits, purges, salivation,
and especially bleeding. Rush, a signer of the Declaration of
Independence, is notorious in medical history for his resorting to massive
bleedings during the epidemics of yellow fever at the end of the
eighteenth century. Rush told a crowd of people in 1793: &#8220;I treat my
patients successfully by bloodletting, and copious purging with calomel
and jalop and I advise you, my good friends, to use the same remedies.&#8221;
&#8220;What?&#8221; called a voice from the crowd, &#8220;Bleed and purge everyone?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
said the doctor, &#8220;bleed and purge all Kensington.&#8221;<small><a name="f61.1" id="f61.1" href="#f61">[61]</a></small></p>

<p>The alternatives to bleeding in this period included administering mercury
(calomel) to promote salivation and tartar emetic to induce vomiting.
These substitutes could be as hazardous as bleeding and offered little
choice to the patient who had to bear the unpleasant effects. Thus, the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth century has been referred to by
historians as the era of heroic medicine because of the large amounts of
strong medications given and excessive bloodletting.<small><a name="f62.1" id="f62.1" href="#f62">[62]</a></small></p>

<p>One of the most notable victims of heroic medicine during this period was
George Washington (1732-1799), who was bled four times in two days after
having contracted a severe inflammation of the throat. Washington&#8217;s
physician, Dr. Craik, admitted that the removal of too much blood might
have been the cause of his death. Additional bleeding was prevented only
by Washington&#8217;s request to be allowed to die without further medical
intervention, since he believed that his illness was incurable.<small><a name="f63.1" id="f63.1" href="#f63">[63]</a></small></p>

<p>Bloodletting was especially resorted to in times of crisis. One woman,
Hannah Green, had been anesthetized in 1848 by chloroform before
undergoing a minor operation on her toe. The physician bled her in a
futile attempt to revive her, but she died, becoming the first known
victim of inhalation anesthesia.<small><a name="f64.1" id="f64.1" href="#f64">[64]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>Spring Lancets</i></p>

<p>The great vogue in phlebotomy inspired the invention of ingenious
instruments. From Vienna came the automatic or spring lancet, originally
called a <i>Schnepper</i> or <i>Schnepperlein</i>, which permitted the operator to
inject the blade into a vein without exerting manual pressure.<small><a name="f65.1" id="f65.1" href="#f65">[65]</a></small> It was
widely adopted if the variety of models now extant is a proper indication.
In the spring lancet, the blade was fixed into a small metal case with a
screw and arranged to respond to a spring that could be released by a
button or lever on the outside of the case. The blade was positioned at
right angles to the spring and case, thus adopting the basic shape of the
fleam. The case of the spring lancet was usually made of copper, silver,
brass, or an alloy. It was often decorated with engraved furbelows or
embossed with political or other symbols depending on the preference of
the owner and the fashion of the period. The mechanism of this handsome
implement has been described by a modern collector (Figures <a href="#fig6and7">6, 7</a>):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The curved projection (1) is the continuation of a heavy coiled
spring. When pushed up it catches on a ratchet. A razor sharp blade
(2), responding to the pressure of a light spring placed under it,
follows the handle as it goes up. A lever (3) acting on a fulcrum (4)
when pressed down, releases handle which in turn strikes the lancet
down with lightning speed.<small><a name="f66.1" id="f66.1" href="#f66">[66]</a></small></p></div>

<p>The spring lancet was initially described by Lorenz Heister in 1719.<small><a name="f67.1" id="f67.1" href="#f67">[67]</a></small>
Another early description appeared in 1798 in the first American edition
of the <i>Encyclopedia or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</i>, in which the
spring lancet was called a &#8220;phleam.&#8221;<small><a name="f68.1" id="f68.1" href="#f68">[68]</a></small></p>

<p>The spring lancet for use on humans was a rather tiny instrument. Its
casing was about 4 cm long and 1.5 to 2 cm wide. The blade added
another centimeter in length. Larger size instruments, often with a metal
guard over the blade, were made for use on animals. Eighteenth- and early
nineteenth-century spring lancets are found in a wide variety of shapes.
Mid- and late nineteenth-century spring lancets are more uniform in shape,
most having the familiar knob-shaped end. In most lancets the blade was
released by a lever, but in the late nineteenth century, the blade of a
more expensive model was released by a button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>In general, German, American, and Dutch surgeons preferred the spring
lancet to the simple thumb lancet. In contrast, the French tended to
prefer the thumb lancet. Ristelhueber, a surgeon in Strasbourg, maintained
in 1819 that the simple lancet was preferable to the spring lancet both in
terms of simplicity of design and application. While allowing German
surgeons some credit for attempting to improve the spring lancet,
<ins class="correction" title="original: Ristelheuber">Ristelhueber</ins> remained firm in his view that the spring lancet was too
complicated and performed no better than the thumb lancet. The only
advantage of the spring lancet was that it could be used by those who were
ignorant of anatomy and the art of venesection. Untutored bleeders could
employ a spring lancet on those veins that stood out prominently and be
fairly confident that they could remove blood without harming other blood
vessels. The bagnio men (bath attendants), who routinely bled the bathers
in public baths, preferred the spring lancet.<small><a name="f69.1" id="f69.1" href="#f69">[69]</a></small> It was more difficult to
sever a vein with a spring lancet and thereby cause serious hemorrhaging.
However, since the spring lancet was harder to clean because of its small
size and its enclosed parts, it was more likely to induce infection
(phlebitis).</p>

<p>While the French and British surgeons remained critical of the spring
lancet, it became popular in the United States. John Syng Dorsey, a noted
Philadelphia surgeon, wrote in 1813:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The German fleam or spring lancet I prefer greatly to the common
English lancet for phlebotomy; it is now in some parts of the United
States almost exclusively used. In a country situated like the United
States, where every surgeon, except those residing in our largest
cities, is compelled to be his own cutler, at least so far as to keep
his instruments in order, the spring-lancet has a decided preference
over the lancet; the blade of this can with great ease be sharpened
by any man of common dexterity, and if not very keen it does no
mischief, whereas a dull lancet is a most dangerous instrument; and
no one can calculate with certainty the depth to which it will
enter. To sharpen a lancet, is regarded by the cutler as one of his
nicest and most difficult jobs; it is one to which few surgeons are
competent.</p>

<p>The safety of using the fleam is demonstrated by daily experience;
there is no country in which venesection is more frequently performed
than in the United States, and perhaps none where fewer accidents
from the operation have occurred, of those few, I beg leave to state,
that all the aneurisms produced by bleeding, which I have seen, have
been in cases where the lancet was used. Among the advantages of the
spring-lancet economy is not the least. A country practitioner who is
constantly employing English lancets, and who is particular in using
none but the best, must necessarily consume half the emoluement
derived from the operation, in the purchase of his instruments. One
spring-lancet, with an occasional new blade, will serve him all his
life.<small><a name="f70.1" id="f70.1" href="#f70">[70]</a></small></p></div>

<p>This popularity is also reflected in various medical dictionaries of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that described the instrument and in
the wide variety of spring lancets in the Smithsonian collection.</p>

<p>One American user of the spring lancet, J. E. Snodgrass of Baltimore, was
inspired to compose a poem about the instrument, which appeared in the
<i>Baltimore <ins class="correction" title="original: Pheonix">Phoenix</ins> and Budget</i> in 1841. He wrote:</p>


<p class="center"><br />To My Spring-Lancet</p>

<p>There was little change in the mechanism of the spring lancet during the
nineteenth century, despite the efforts of inventors to improve it.
Approximately five American patents on variations of the spring lancet
were granted in the nineteenth century. One patent model survives in the
Smithsonian collection. Joseph Gordon of Catonsville, Maryland, in 1857
received patent No. 16479 for a spring lancet constructed so that three
different positions of the ratchet could be set by the sliding shield. The
position of the ratchet regulated the force with which the blade entered
the vein. This also had the advantage of allowing the blade to enter the
vein at the same angle irrespective of the depth to which it
penetrated.<small><a name="f71.1" id="f71.1" href="#f71">[71]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>The Decline of Bleeding</i></p>

<p>Throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, most
physicians of note, regardless of their explanations of disease, including
Hermann Boerhaave, Gerard Van Swieten, Georg Ernst Stahl (phlogiston),
John Brown and Friedrich Hoffmann (mechanistic theories), Johann Peter
Frank, Albrecht von Haller, Percival Pott, John Pringle, William Cullen,
and Francois Broussais, recommended bloodletting and adjusted their
theories to provide an explanation for its value. At the end of the
eighteenth century and in the early nineteenth century, the practice of
bloodletting reached a high point with the theories of F.-J.-V. Broussais
(1772-1838) and others. After 1830, however, the practice gradually
declined until, by the end of the century, it had all but disappeared.</p>

<p>This decline occurred even though many medical theories were brought to
the defense of bleeding. A French medical observer commented in 1851 that
&#8220;l&#8217;histoire de la saign&eacute;e consider&eacute;e dans son ensemble, constituerait
presque &agrave; elle seule l&#8217;histoire de toutes les doctrines m&eacute;dicales&#8221; (the
history of bloodletting, considered in its totality, would constitute
almost by itself the history of all medical doctrines).<small><a name="f72.1" id="f72.1" href="#f72">[72]</a></small> There was no
crisis of medical opinion, and no one event to account for this decline.
The French physician, Pierre Louis&#8217;s statistical investigation (numerical
method) into the effect of bloodletting in the treatment of pneumonia has
often been cited as a cause for the downfall of venesection,<small><a name="f73.1" id="f73.1" href="#f73">[73]</a></small> but the
results of Louis&#8217;s research showed only that bloodletting was not as
useful as was previously thought. Louis&#8217;s work, however, was typical of a
new and critical attitude in the nineteenth century towards all
traditional remedies. A number of investigators in France, Austria,
England, and America did clinical studies comparing the recovery rates of
those who were bled and those who were not.<small><a name="f74.1" id="f74.1" href="#f74">[74]</a></small> Other physicians attempted
to measure, by new instruments and techniques, the physiological affects
of loss of blood. Once pathological anatomy had associated disease
entities with specific lesions, physicians sought to discover exactly how
remedies such as bloodletting would affect these lesions. In the case of
pneumonia, for example, those who defined the disease as &#8220;an exudation
into the vessels and tissues of the lungs&#8221; could not see how bloodletting
could remove the coagulation. John Hughes Bennett, an Edinburgh physician,
wrote in 1855: &#8220;It is doubtful whether a large bleeding from the arm can
operate upon the stagnant blood in the pulmonary capillaries&mdash;that it can
directly affect the coagulated exudation is impossible.&#8221;<small><a name="f75.1" id="f75.1" href="#f75">[75]</a></small> Bennett felt
that bloodletting merely reduced the strength of the patient and thus
impeded recovery.</p>

<p>Bloodletting was attacked not only by medical investigators, but much more
vehemently by members of such medical sects as the homeopaths and botanics
who sought to replace the harsh remedies of the regular physicians by
their own milder systems of therapeutics.<small><a name="f76.1" id="f76.1" href="#f76">[76]</a></small></p>

<p>As a result of all this criticism the indications for bleeding were
gradually narrowed, until at the present time bloodletting is used in only
a few very specific important instances.</p>

<p>In England and America, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, a
last serious attempt was made to revive bloodletting before it died out
altogether. A number of Americans defended the limited use of bleeding,
especially in the form of venesection. The noted American physician, Henry
I. Bowditch, tried in 1872 to arouse support for venesection among his
Massachusetts Medical Society colleagues. He noted that venesection
declined more than any other medical opinion in the esteem of the
physician and the public during the previous half century. At the
beginning of his career, he had ignored the request of his patients who
wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> annual bloodlettings to &#8220;breathe a vein&#8221; to maintain good health.
He eventually found that to give up the practice entirely was as wrong as
to overdo it when severe symptoms of a violent, acute cardiac disease
presented themselves. Lung congestion and dropsy were other common
disorders that seemed to him to be relieved, at least temporarily, by
venesection.<small><a name="f77.1" id="f77.1" href="#f77">[77]</a></small></p>

<p>In 1875 the Englishman W. Mitchell Clarke, after reviewing the long
history of bloodletting and commenting on the abrupt cessation of the
practice in his own time, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Experience must, indeed, as Hippocrates says in his first aphorism,
be fallacious if we decide that a means of treatment, sanctioned by
the use of between two and three thousand years, and upheld by the
authority of the ablest men of past times, is finally and forever
given up. This seems to me to be the most interesting and important
question in connection with this subject. Is the relinquishment of
bleeding final? or shall we see by and by, or will our successors
see, a resumption of the practice? This, I take it, is a very
difficult question to answer; and he would be a very bold man who,
after looking carefully through the history of the past, would
venture to assert that bleeding will not be profitably employed any
more.<small><a name="f78.1" id="f78.1" href="#f78">[78]</a></small></p></div>

<p>An intern, Henri A. Lafleur of the newly founded Johns Hopkins Hospital,
reported on five patients on whom venesection was performed between 1889
and 1891. Lafleur defended his interest in the subject by calling
attention to other recent reports of successes with bleeding, such as that
of Dr. Pye-Smith of London. He concluded that at least temporary relief
from symptoms due to circulatory disorders, especially those involving the
pulmonary system, was achieved through venesection.</p>

<p>Pneumonia and pleurisy were the primary diseases for which venesection was
an approved remedy.<small><a name="f79.1" id="f79.1" href="#f79">[79]</a></small> It had long been believed by bloodletters that
these complaints were especially amenable to an early and repeated
application of the lancet.<small><a name="f80.1" id="f80.1" href="#f80">[80]</a></small> Austin Flint had explained in 1867 that
bloodletting &#8220;is perhaps more applicable to the treatment of inflammation
affecting the pulmonary organs than to the treatment of other inflammatory
affections, in consequence of the relations of the former [pulmonary
organs] to the circulation.&#8221;<small><a name="f81.1" id="f81.1" href="#f81">[81]</a></small> Thus, while bloodletting for other
diseases declined throughout the nineteenth century, it continued to be
advocated for treating apoplexy, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.<small><a name="f82.1" id="f82.1" href="#f82">[82]</a></small></p>

<p>The merit of phlebotomy for those afflicted with congestive heart failure
was emphasized again in 1912 by H. A. Christian. This condition led to
engorgement of the lungs and liver and increased pressure in the venous
side of the circulation. Articles advocating bloodletting continued into
the 1920s and 1930s.<small><a name="f83.1" id="f83.1" href="#f83">[83]</a></small></p>

<p>Bloodletting is currently being tested as a treatment for those suffering
from angina or heart attacks. Blood is removed on a scheduled basis to
maintain the hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells in the blood)
at a specified level. Keeping the hematocrit low has provided relief to
those being tested.<small><a name="f84.1" id="f84.1" href="#f84">[84]</a></small> Other benefits of removing blood, including the
lowering of blood pressure, can be obtained by the use of antihypertensive
drugs. Thus the valid indications for bleeding are being supplanted by the
use of modern drugs that accomplish the same end.</p>

<p>By the twentieth century the lancet was replaced in some quarters by safer
devices for removing blood and injecting fluids into the bloodstream.
Heinrich Stern improved Strauss&#8217;s special hyperdermic needle. In 1905
Stern designed a venepuncture or aspirating needle that was 7 cm long with
a silver cannula of 4 cm. Attached to the handle was a thumb-rest and a
tube for removing or adding fluids and a perforator within the cannula. He
recommended that the forearm be strapped above the elbow and that the
instrument be thrust into the most prominent vein. This streamlined vein
puncturing implement reduced the possibility of injecting air and bacteria
into the blood.<small><a name="f85.1" id="f85.1" href="#f85">[85]</a></small> It was, and continues to be, used to withdraw blood
for study in the laboratory, to aid in diagnosis of disease, and to
collect blood for transfusing into those who need additional blood during
an operation or to replace blood lost in an accident or disease. The blood
is collected in a glass or plastic graduated container and stored under
refrigeration. The study of blood donors has, incidentally, given insights
into the physiology of bloodletting since the volume customarily removed
from a donor is about the same in volume as that taken by a bleeder (one
pint or 500 cc).<small><a name="f86.1" id="f86.1" href="#f86">[86]</a></small></p>

<p>The annual physical examination today includes taking a small amount of
blood from the finger or a vein in the elbow. This blood is then analyzed
for the presence of biochemical components of such diseases as diabetes,
anemia, arteriosclerosis, etc. A tiny sterile instrument called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> blood

<h3>Cupping</h3>

<p>&#8220;Cupping is an art,&#8221; wrote the London cupper Samuel Bayfield in 1823, &#8220;the
value of which every one can appreciate who has had opportunities of being
made acquainted with its curative power by observing its effects on the
person of others, or by realizing them in his own.&#8221;<small><a name="f87.1" id="f87.1" href="#f87">[87]</a></small> The curious
operation of taking blood by means of exhausted cups had been part of
Western medicine since the time of Hippocrates, and has been found in many
other cultures as well. It is still practiced in some parts of the world
today.</p>

<p>Since antiquity medical authors have distinguished two forms of cupping,
dry and wet. In dry cupping, no blood was actually removed from the body.
A cup was exhausted of air and applied to the skin, causing the skin to
tumefy. In wet cupping, dry cupping was followed by the forming of several
incisions in the skin and a reapplication of the cups in order to collect
blood. It was possible to scarify parts of the body without
cupping&mdash;through the nineteenth-century physicians recommended scarifying
the lips, the nasal passages, the eyes, and the uterus. In order to remove
any sizeable amount of blood, however, it was necessary to apply some sort
of suction to the scarifications, because capillaries, unlike arteries and
veins, do not bleed freely. (Figure <a href="#fig8">8</a>.)</p>

<p>Cupping was generally regarded as an auxiliary to venesection. The
indications for the operation were about the same as the indications for
phlebotomy, except that there was a tendency to prefer cupping in cases of
localized pain or inflammation, or if the patient was too young, too old,
or too weak to withstand phlebotomy. &#8220;If cutting a vein is an instant
danger, or if the mischief is still localised, recourse is to be had
rather to cupping,&#8221; wrote the encyclopedist Celsus in the first century
<span class="smcaplc">A.D.</span><small><a name="f88.1" id="f88.1" href="#f88">[88]</a></small></p>

<p>As noted above, the ancients usually recommended cupping close to the seat
of the disease. However, there were several examples in ancient writings
of cupping a distant part in order to divert blood. The most famous of
these examples was Hippocrates&#8217; recommendation of cupping the breasts in
order to relieve excessive menstruation.<small><a name="f89.1" id="f89.1" href="#f89">[89]</a></small></p>

<p>As was the case for phlebotomy, the number of ills that were supposedly
relieved by cupping was enormous. Thomas Mapleson, a professional cupper,
gave the following list of &#8220;diseases in which cupping is generally
employed with advantage&#8221; in 1801:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Apoplexy, angina pectoris, asthma, spitting blood, bruises, cough,
catarrh, consumption, contusion, convulsions, cramps, diseases of the
hip and knee joints, deafness, delirium, dropsy, epilepsy,
erysipelas, eruptions, giddiness, gout, whooping cough,
hydrocephalus, head ache, inflammation of the lungs, intoxication,
lethargy, lunacy, lumbago, measles, numbness of the limbs,
obstructions, ophthalmia, pleurisy, palsy, defective perspiration,
peripneumony, rheumatism, to procure rest, sciatica, shortness of
breath, sore throat, pains of the side and chest.<small><a name="f90.1" id="f90.1" href="#f90">[90]</a></small></p></div>


<p><br /><i>Early Cupping Instruments</i></p>

<p>Mapleson believed that cupping was first suggested by the ancient practice
of sucking blood from poisoned wounds. In any case, the earliest cupping
instruments were hollowed horns or gourds with a small hole at the top by
which the cupper could suck out the blood from scarifications previously
made by a knife. The Arabs called these small vessels &#8220;pumpkins&#8221; to
indicate that they were frequently applied to a part of the body in which
the organs contained air or that they were vessels that had to be
evacuated before they could be applied.<small><a name="f91.1" id="f91.1" href="#f91">[91]</a></small> The use of cattle horns for
cupping purposes seems to have been prevalent in all periods up to the
present. When Prosper Alpinus visited Egypt in the sixteenth century, he
found the Egyptians using horns that were provided with a small valve of
sheepskin to be maintained in place by the cupper&#8217;s tongue and serving to
prevent the intake of air once the cup was exhausted.<small><a name="f92.1" id="f92.1" href="#f92">[92]</a></small></p>

<p>In nineteenth-century America, at least one physician still recommended
horns as superior to glass cups for rural medical practice. A Virginia
physician, Dr. W. A. Gillespie, disturbed by the high cost of cupping
instruments, suggested to his readers in <i>The Boston Medical and Surgical
Journal</i> for 1834 that since glass cups were often broken when carried
from place to place, &#8220;an excellent substitute can be made of a small cow
horn, cornicula, which may be scraped or polished until perfectly
diaphanous or transparent.&#8221;<small><a name="f93.1" id="f93.1" href="#f93">[93]</a></small></p>

<p>The Smithsonian collection contains a cow&#8217;s horn from Madaoua, Niger
Republic (West Africa), used for drawing blood in the 1960s. The director
of the Baptist Mission, who sent the horn, noted that he had often seen
Africans sitting in the market place with such horns on their backs or
their heads. Scarifications were made with a handmade razor.<small><a name="f94.1" id="f94.1" href="#f94">[94]</a></small></p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Figure 8.</span>&mdash;Scarification without cupping in Egypt in the
16th century. To obtain sufficient blood, 20 to 40 gashes were made in the
legs and the patient was made to stand in a basin of warm water. (From
Prosper Alpinus, <i>Medicina Aegyptorum</i>, Leyden, 1719. Photo courtesy of NLM.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>In addition to horn cups, the ancients employed bronze cups in which a
vacuum was obtained by inserting a piece of burning flax or linen into the
cup before its application to the skin. Most Greek and Roman cups were
made of metal.<small><a name="f95.1" id="f95.1" href="#f95">[95]</a></small> Although Galen already preferred glass cups to metal
cups for the simple reason that one could see how much blood was being
evacuated, metal cups were used until modern times. Their main virtue was
that they did not break and thus could be easily transported. For this
reason, metal cups were especially useful to military surgeons. Brass and
pewter cups were common in the eighteenth century, and tin cups were sold
in the late nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Since the latter part of antiquity, cups have been made of glass. The
Smithsonian possesses two Persian opaque glass cups dating from the
twelfth century, called &#8220;spouted glasses&#8221; because of the spout protruding
from the side of the cup by which the cupper exhausted the air with his
mouth. Similar spouted glasses were illustrated by Prosper Alpinus
(sixteenth century), so designed that the blood would collect in a
reservoir instead of being sucked into the cupper&#8217;s mouth. Like the horn
cups illustrated by Alpinus, the glass cups were provided with a small
valve made of animal skin. It appears that the sixteenth-century Egyptians
were not familiar with the use of fire for exhausting cups. (Figure <a href="#fig9">9</a>.)</p>

<p>Cupping and leeching were less frequently practiced in the medieval
period, although general bloodletting retained its popularity.<small><a name="f96.1" id="f96.1" href="#f96">[96]</a></small> When
the eastern practice of public steam baths was reintroduced into the West
in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, cupping tended to
be left in the hands of bath attendants (Bagnio men) and ignored by
regular surgeons. Some surgeons, such as Pierre Dionis, who gave a course
of surgery in Paris in the early eighteenth century, saw little value in
the operation. He felt that the ancients had greatly exaggerated the
virtues of the remedy.<small><a name="f97.1" id="f97.1" href="#f97">[97]</a></small> Another French surgeon, Ren&eacute; de Garengeot,
argued in 1725 that those who resorted to such outdated remedies as
cupping had studied the philosophical systems of the ancients more than
they had practiced medicine. He accused the admirers of the ancients of
wishing to kill patients &#8220;with the pompous apparatus of wet cupping.&#8221;<small><a name="f98.1" id="f98.1" href="#f98">[98]</a></small>

(NMHT 224478 [M-8037]; SI photo 73-4215.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nineteenth-century cuppers tended to blame the baths for the low status of
cupping among surgeons. Dionis had described the baths in Germany as great
vaulted halls with benches on two sides, one side for men and the other
for women. Members of both sexes, nude except for a piece of linen around
the waist, sat in the steamy room and were cupped, if they so desired, by
the bath attendants. The customers&#8217; vanity was satisfied by making the
scarifications (which left scars) in the form of hearts, love-knots, and
monograms.<small><a name="f99.1" id="f99.1" href="#f99">[99]</a></small> Mapleson&#8217;s complaint against the baths in 1813 was typical
of the reaction of the nineteenth-century professional cupper:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The custom which appears to have become prevalent of resorting to
these Bagnios, or Haumaums, to be bathed and cupped, appears to have
superseded the practice of this operation by the regular surgeons.
Falling into the hands of mere hirelings, who practiced without
knowledge, and without any other principle than one merely mercenary,
the operation appears to have fallen into contempt, to have been
neglected by Physicians, because patients had recourse to it without
previous advice, and disparaged by regular Surgeons, because, being
performed by others, it diminished the profits of their
profession.<small><a name="f100.1" id="f100.1" href="#f100">[100]</a></small></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>After a period of neglect, cupping enjoyed renewed popularity in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In that period a number of
professional cuppers practiced in the cities of Europe and America. Both
Guy&#8217;s and Westminster Hospitals in London employed a professional cupper
to aid physicians and surgeons. Of these hospital cuppers, at least four,
Thomas Mapleson, Samuel Bayfield, George Frederick Knox, and Monson Hills
published treatises on the art of cupping, from which we gain the clearest
account of cupping procedure.<small><a name="f101.1" id="f101.1" href="#f101">[101]</a></small> Knox, who succeeded Mapleson as Cupper
at Westminster Hospital, was petitioned by 59 medical and surgical
students to write his practical and portable text.<small><a name="f102.1" id="f102.1" href="#f102">[102]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>Instruments of the Professional Cupper</i></p>

<p>Cupping instruments in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were
generally simple dome-shaped glass cups provided with thick rims so that
the cups would be less painful when applied and removed. Cups were sold in
various sizes, ranging from about 45 mm to 75 mm high. Some were made with
a smaller diameter and a larger belly for cupping on parts of the body
with a limited surface area. For the same reason, cups with an oval rim
were recommended. (Figure <a href="#fig11">11</a>.)</p>

<p>There were several common methods for exhausting cups, of which the
simplest and most widely used was that of throwing burning lint or tow
(the coarse part of flax, hemp, or jute) inside the glass before applying
the glass to the skin of the patient. The professional cuppers vehemently
disapproved of this clumsy practice, for the patient could easily be
scorched.<small><a name="f103.1" id="f103.1" href="#f103">[103]</a></small> Various improvements were suggested to avoid burning the
patient. Dionis (1708) had recommended placing a small card with lighted
candles over the scarifications, and then applying the cup.<small><a name="f104.1" id="f104.1" href="#f104">[104]</a></small> Other
methods included the brief introduction of a wire holding a bit of sponge
soaked with alcohol and ignited, or attaching a bit of sponge to the
inside of the glass by means of wax and a piece of wood. All such methods
were deemed &#8220;clumsy expedients&#8221; by professional cuppers,<small><a name="f105.1" id="f105.1" href="#f105">[105]</a></small> who
preferred to employ a lamp or torch especially made for cupping.
Eighteenth-century surgical texts illustrated brass grease lamps with
covers to regulate the flame. Probably less difficult to maneuver was the
alcohol lamp first introduced in the 1790s. Alcohol lamps for cupping were
made of metal, shaped like teapots, and contained a heavy cotton wick
protruding from the spout.<small><a name="f106.1" id="f106.1" href="#f106">[106]</a></small></p>

<p><a name="fig11" id="fig11"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figure 11.</span>&mdash;Typical glass cupping cups, late 19th century.<br />
(NMHT 152130 [M-4766-68]; SI Photo 61135-C.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Mapleson (1813) employed an alcohol lamp, the cuppers writing
after him preferred the more recently-introduced cupping torch. This
consisted of a piece of hollow metal tubing cut obliquely at one end and
provided with a metal bulb or ring at the other end. A cotton wick was
stuffed as compactly as possible into the tube so that a small piece of
wick protruded from the oblique end. The wick was dipped in alcohol,
ignited, and inserted briefly into the cup. The torch was more convenient
than the older teapot lamp because it was easier to insert into the cup,
and was small enough to hold in the hand at the same time as one held the
scarificator.<small><a name="f107.1" id="f107.1" href="#f107">[107]</a></small></p>

<p>The introduction of the scarificator represented the major change in the
art of cupping between antiquity and the nineteenth century. Unlike later
attempts at improving cupping technology, the scarificator was almost
universally adopted. Previous to its invention, the cupper, following
ancient practice, severed the capillaries by making a series of parallel
incisions with a lancet, fleam, or other surgical knife.<small><a name="f108.1" id="f108.1" href="#f108">[108]</a></small> This was a
messy, time consuming, and painful procedure. Ambroise Par&eacute; (1510?-1590)
was the first to employ the word &#8220;scarificator&#8221; and the first to
illustrate a special instrument for scarification in his compendium of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
surgical instruments.<small><a name="f109.1" id="f109.1" href="#f109">[109]</a></small> However, a precursor to the scarificator had
been suggested by Paulus of Aegina (625-690), who described an instrument
constructed of three lancets joined together so that in one application
three incisions could be made in the skin. The instrument, recommended for
the removal of coagulated blood in the wake of a blow, was considered
difficult to use and was not generally adopted.<small><a name="f110.1" id="f110.1" href="#f110">[110]</a></small> Par&eacute;&#8217;s scarificator
had a circular case and eighteen blades attached to three rods projecting
from the bottom. A pin projecting from the side may have served to lift
the blades and a button on the top to release them although Par&eacute; did not
describe the spring mechanism.<small><a name="f111.1" id="f111.1" href="#f111">[111]</a></small> Par&eacute; did not recommend the instrument
for cupping, but rather for the treatment of gangrene. Several sixteenth-
and seventeenth-century surgical texts made reference to Par&eacute;&#8217;s
instrument, among them Jacques Delechamps (1569) and Hellkiah Crooke
(1631).<small><a name="f112.1" id="f112.1" href="#f112">[112]</a></small></p>

<p>It is not known who made the first square scarificator and adapted it to
cupping. The instrument was not found in Dionis (1708), but it did appear
in Heister (1719) and in Garengeot (1725). Thus it appears that the
scarificator was invented between 1708 and 1719. Garengeot disliked
cupping in general and he had little good to say of the new mechanical
scarificator. &#8220;A nasty instrument,&#8221; he called it, &#8220;good only for show.&#8221;<small><a name="f113.1" id="f113.1" href="#f113">[113]</a></small>
The German surgeon, Lorenz Heister, was more appreciative of the
innovation. After describing the older method of making sixteen to twenty
small wounds in the skin with a knife, he announced that &#8220;The modern
surgeons have, for Conveniency for themselves and Ease to the Patient,
contrived a Scarificator ... which consists of 16 small Lancet-blades
fixed in a cubical Brass Box, with a Steel Spring.&#8221;<small><a name="f114.1" id="f114.1" href="#f114">[114]</a></small> Heister noted
that while Par&eacute; had used the scarificator only for incipient
mortification, it was now &#8220;used with good success by our Cuppers in many
other Diseases, as I myself have frequently seen and experienced.&#8221;<small><a name="f115.1" id="f115.1" href="#f115">[115]</a></small></p>

<p>The earliest scarificators were simple square brass boxes, with cocking
and release levers and 16 pointed blades. By 1780, illustrations in
surgical works showed that the bottom of the scarificator was detachable.
Thus, although the illustrations do not show the screw for regulating the
height of the blade cover, provision may already have been made for
adjusting the depth of cut of the blades.<small><a name="f116.1" id="f116.1" href="#f116">[116]</a></small> Square or German-style
scarificators continued to be sold in Germany throughout the nineteenth
century. The earlier models (late eighteenth, early nineteenth century)
were frequently embellished with ornate decoration, and had pointed
blades. Some were quite tall. A specimen dated 1747, in the Wellcome
Medical Museum collection, is 14.4 cm high and 4.5 cm wide at the base.

(Held by the Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine, London. Photo courtesy of the Wellcome.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The later models (mid- to late nineteenth century) were wider and plainer
and had arched or crescent shaped blades (which made a cleaner lesion),
but the internal mechanism remained the same. Square scarificators all had
16 steel blades that cut in the same direction and were arranged on three
rods of five, six, and five blades respectively. At one end of each rod
was a gear pinion. The cocking lever, protruding through an aperture at
the top of the scarificator, broadened out into a flat plate with as many
gear sectors as blade rods. The plate was held against the interior of the
scarificator by a heavy support rod running the width of the scarificator,
in such a way that the gear sectors of the cocking lever meshed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
pinions on the blade rods. Pulling up on the cocking lever turned the
blades 180 degrees. A heavy flat cantilever spring, attached at one end to
the bottom of the case, was caught under a protuberance on the cocking
lever and bent as the cocking lever was pulled. As the blades were turned,
a catch slipped over a tooth on the cocking lever, and held the blades in
place. Nineteenth-century octagonal scarificators generally had two
catches, the first exposing the blades, and the second rotating them a
full 180 degrees. Pressure on the release lever pushed the catch off the
tooth on the cocking lever, thereby releasing the lever and allowing the
spring to snap the apparatus back to its original position. Releasing the
spring brought the blades around so quickly that their movement could not
be seen. (Figure <a href="#fig13">13</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="fig13" id="fig13"></a>&nbsp;</p>

[M-4771]; SI photo 76-9111.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the square scarificators, the top and two sides were detachable from
the bottom and the other two sides. Turning the wing-tip nut on the top of
the scarificator lowered, by means of a yoke, the bottom of the
scarificator that was fitted by grooves into the top. By raising and
lowering the bottom, one could regulate the length of blade protruding
beyond the bottom, and hence the depth of cut.</p>

<p>In the 1790s, the octagonal scarificator that was to become the standard
English-American model began to appear in surgical texts. The early
octagonal scarificator, as illustrated in Latta (1795) and Bell (1801),
had sixteen rounded blades arranged as in the square scarificator, an iron
triggering lever similar to that of the square scarificator, a button
release on the side, and a flat key on top for regulating depth of
cut.<small><a name="f117.1" id="f117.1" href="#f117">[117]</a></small> Early in the nineteenth century the flat keys were replaced by
round screws. Only the bottom or blade cover of the octagonal scarificator
was detachable. In some of the octagonal scarificators, the round screw on
top ran the height of the scarificator and screwed directly into an
internally threaded post inside the blade cover. In other scarificators,
the screw raised and lowered a yoke whose two sides were attached by
additional screws to side projections of the blade cover.</p>

<p>A notable improvement was made in the early nineteenth century when John
Weiss, a London instrument maker, introduced a 12 blade octagonal
scarificator whose blades, arranged on two rods or pinions, were made to
cut in opposite directions. This advance was mentioned by Mapleson in 1813
and adopted by London professional cuppers thereafter. The advantage of
the innovations was that the skin was thereby stretched, and a smoother,
more regular cut could be made. Weiss&#8217;s Improved Scarificator also
featured blades that could easily be removed for cleaning and repair. In
place of two rows of six blades, one could insert a single row of four
blades to adopt the scarificator for cupping on small areas such as the
temple.<small><a name="f118.1" id="f118.1" href="#f118">[118]</a></small> The feature of inserting a pinion with clean and sharp blades
permitted the cupper to own only two scarificators. For cleansing the
blades the manufacturer supplied a thin piece of wood covered with wash
leather or the pith of the elder tree.<small><a name="f119.1" id="f119.1" href="#f119">[119]</a></small></p>

<p>Scarificators in which the blade rods turned in opposite directions
(called &#8220;reversible&#8221; scarificators in trade catalogs) were more
complicated to manufacture and therefore somewhat more expensive than
unidirectional scarificators. The cocking lever meshed directly with only
the first blade rod. To make the second blade rod turn in the opposite
direction, an extra geared plate (or idler lever) was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> necessary to act as
an intermediary between the cocking lever and the second blade pinion. The
cocking lever turned the idler lever, which then turned the second pinion.
Two support rods and two cantilever springs were needed in place of the
one in unidirectional scarificators.</p>

<p>The brass, octagonal scarificator with 8, 10, and particularly 12 blades
became the standard scarificator sold in England and America.<small><a name="f120.1" id="f120.1" href="#f120">[120]</a></small> Both
unidirectional (&#8220;plain&#8221;) and reversible scarificators were offered through
trade catalogs. Smaller octagonal scarificators with four to six blades
were sold for cupping parts of the body with limited surface area.</p>


<p><br /><i>Cupping Procedure</i></p>

<p>The art of cupping, it was generally agreed, required a high degree of
dexterity that could be maintained only by constant practice. Professional
cuppers were concerned with avoiding any appearance of clumsiness, else
the patient might come to fear an operation essential to his health. In
the hands of an inexperienced physician or surgeon, cupping could be
highly painful to the patient, and yet fail to produce the requisite
amount of blood. While expert cuppers were usually available in cities,
the rural doctor was not trained in the operation. It was to these rural
practitioners that the treatises of the professional cuppers were
addressed. One cupper, George Frederick Knox, offered in addition personal
instruction in cupping procedures. His charge was a guinea for medical
students and three guineas for non-medical students for a three month
course.<small><a name="f121.1" id="f121.1" href="#f121">[121]</a></small></p>

<p>Physicians and surgeons took a renewed interest in cupping in the early
nineteenth century. Cupping was no longer regarded as merely a useful
substitute for bloodletting. Recent physiological research seemed to prove
to the advocates of cupping that the effects of slow withdrawal of blood
from the capillaries produced a different effect on the constitution than
the quick withdrawal of blood from a vein. Thus, Knox was convinced by the
results of this research that, while phlebotomy was indicated in cases of
high fever, &#8220;particular phlegmasiae&#8221; specifically required the
intervention of cupping.<small><a name="f122.1" id="f122.1" href="#f122">[122]</a></small></p>

<p>The procedure that the experts followed in wet cupping was as follows.
First, the cups were immersed in hot water. Bayfield recommended that one
glass be used for every four ounces of blood required. Thus, to abstract
18 to 20 ounces, as was common in cupping on the back or abdomen, four or
five glasses were needed. The spot chosen for placement of the cups should
be free of bone, but also not overly fatty. Cupping over the belly of a
muscle was especially recommended. After the spot was fomented with hot
water, the torch was dipped in alcohol, lit, and inserted into the cup for
about two seconds. Once the torch was removed, the cup was allowed to sink
of its own weight into the skin. During the minute that the skin was
allowed to tumefy under the cup, the scarificator was warmed in the palm
of the hand in preparation for the most difficult part of the operation.
It required great skill to manage torch, scarificator, and cups in such a
way as to lift the cup, scarify, and recup before the tumefaction had
subsided. Monson Hills (1834) described the manipulations involved thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The torch is held in and across the palm of the right hand, by the
little and ring finger, leaving the thumb, the fore and middle
fingers free to hold the scarificator, which may be done by the thumb
and fore finger only; the glass is then grasped by the thumb, fore
and middle fingers of the left hand, leaving the little and ring
fingers free; the edge of the glass is then detached from the skin by
the middle finger of the right hand; the scarificator being set, care
must be taken not to press upon the button with the thumb too
quickly; directly the glass comes off, we apply the scarificator,
spring it through the integuments, and then placing it between the
free little and ring fingers of the left hand, we apply the torch to
the glass, and glass to the skin over the incisions, as before
recommended.<small><a name="f123.1" id="f123.1" href="#f123">[123]</a></small></p></div>

<p>Hills recommended practicing on a table, &#8220;taking care, of course, that the
lancets are not allowed to strike the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Bayfield, the blades of the scarificator were generally set
at &#188;&#8243;. If cupping behind the ears, they should be set at
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><sup>1</sup></span>&frasl;<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">7</span>&#8243;, if on the
temple at &#8539;&#8243;, and if on the scalp at &#8537;&#8243;. When the cups were two-thirds
full, they were removed and reapplied if necessary. This, too, was no easy
task. One had to manipulate cup and sponge deftly in order to avoid
spillage. Cupping was to be not merely a neat operation, but an elegant
one. After cupping, the wound was dabbed with alcohol or dressed, if
necessary. Scarificator blades could be used some twenty times. After each
use, the scarificator was to be cleaned and greased by springing it
through a piece of mutton fat.<small><a name="f124.1" id="f124.1" href="#f124">[124]</a></small></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>A great variety of bodily parts were cupped, just about any part that had
sufficient surface area to hold a small cup in place. Knox, for example,
gave directions for cupping on the temple, back of the head, behind the
ears, throat, back of the neck, extremities, shin, chest, side, abdomen,
back and loins, back of the thighs, perineum, sacrum, and on buboes.<small><a name="f125.1" id="f125.1" href="#f125">[125]</a></small>
In reply to those who wondered if cupping hurt, Knox asserted that &#8220;those
who calculate the pain incurred in cupping by comparison with a cut finger
are very much deceived.&#8221; The scarificator itself produced little pain, he
claimed, but he admitted that the pressure of the rims of the glasses
could cause a degree of discomfort.<small><a name="f126.1" id="f126.1" href="#f126">[126]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>Nineteenth Century Attempts to Improve Cupping Technology</i></p>

<p>The story of nineteenth-century attempts to improve cupping technology is
an interesting one, in that a great deal of effort was expended on
comparatively short-lived results. For those who were adept at cupping,
the cups, torch, and standard scarificator were quite adequate.
Innovations were thus aimed at making the operation more available to the
less practiced. The new gadgets could not rival the traditional
instruments in the hands of an experienced cupper, and, moreover, they
were usually much more expensive.</p>

<p>Most of the attempts at innovation centered in eliminating the need for an
alcohol lamp or torch to exhaust the cups. As far back as Hero of
Alexandria,<ins class="correction" title="Not in the original."><small><a name="f127.1" id="f127.1" href="#f127">[127]</a></small></ins>
we find directions for the construction of &#8220;a
cupping-glass which shall attract without the aid of fire.&#8221; Hero&#8217;s device
combined mouth suction with a system of valves. Another famous inventor of
assorted devices, Santorio Santorii (1561-1636), described a cup that
contained a syringe in the early seventeenth century.<small><a name="f128.1" id="f128.1" href="#f128">[128]</a></small> From the 1780s
on, cups with brass syringes began to appear in compendia of instruments.
A cup with brass fixings would be screwed onto a brass pump, placed on the
skin, and the air within removed by a few strokes of the piston.<small><a name="f129.1" id="f129.1" href="#f129">[129]</a></small> This
sounded better in theory than it worked in practice. Expert cuppers agreed
that they thoroughly disliked using the syringe. Mapleson (1813) offered
three strong objections to the instrument. First, exhaustion could easily
be carried too far, so as to obstruct the flow of blood. Second, the
operation become tedious and fatiguing to the bloodletter because of the
repeated screwing and unscrewing of syringe and glasses. Third, the valves
were liable to malfunction.<small><a name="f130.1" id="f130.1" href="#f130">[130]</a></small> Twenty-three years later Knox continued
to disapprove of the syringe for the very same reasons. Of all the new
inventions for cupping, he declared in 1836, &#8220;the worst is the syringe, as
it makes that a most complicated and bungling operation that which, with
common care and attention is one of the most simple in surgery.&#8221;<small><a name="f131.1" id="f131.1" href="#f131">[131]</a></small></p>

<p>Despite rejection by experienced cuppers, manufacturing of an air-tight
syringe continued to challenge inventors throughout the nineteenth
century. Some attempted to substitute stopcocks for valves, and some to
place long flexible tubes between pump and glasses so that the pumping
motions would not be communicated to the patient. Pumps were gradually
improved, and, although rarely recommended by experts, were sold in great
numbers as part of fancy and expensive cupping sets. These sets, with
prices as high as fifteen dollars, consisted of a mahogany or leather box
with brass latches, lined in plush, and containing compartments for
scarificators, a brass pump, and an assortment of glasses provided with
metal attachments. Some of the most elegant of the cupping sets were those
made by Maison Charri&egrave;re of Paris. Today the luxury of these cupping sets
seems rather incongruous with the bloody purposes for which the
instruments were used. Yet, the beauty of the instruments and their
containers must have added to the esteem of the physician or surgeon in
the mind of the patient.</p>

<p>Syringes were not only useful in cupping but also were employed in a wide
variety of medical and surgical operations. Creating an all-purpose
syringe that would extract or inject liquids into any part of the body was
yet another inventor&#8217;s dream. Two of the earliest English surgical patents
were awarded to two such syringes. John Read (1760-1847), surgical
instrument maker for the British Army and the East India Company, patented
a pump in 1820 for use in &#8220;extracting poison from the stomach,
administering clysters, introducing tabacco fumes into the bowels,
transfusion of blood, draining off the urine, injecting the bladder,
female injection, anatomical injection, administration of food and
medicine, cupping, drawing the breasts ... &amp;c.&#8221;<small><a name="f132.1" id="f132.1" href="#f132">[132]</a></small> John Weiss, inventor
of the improved scarificator, invented his own patent syringe in 1825,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which he claimed to be superior to all previous syringes because it
employed stopcocks in place of valves, which were subject to leakage and
clogging. Cupping was only one of many operations that could be performed
with its aid. The Truax Surgical Pump is an example of a late
nineteenth-century all-purpose patent pump outfit that included cups among
its numerous optional attachments.<small><a name="f133.1" id="f133.1" href="#f133">[133]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig14">14</a>.)</p>

<p>Those who went a step further in their efforts to improve cupping
procedure attempted to combine cup, lancet, and exhausting apparatus all
in one instrument. Bayfield described and rejected several such devices in
1823, including perhaps the earliest, that of the Frenchman, Demours.
Demours&#8217; instrument, first introduced in 1819, consisted of a cupping
glass with two protruding tubes, one containing a lancet, and the other an
exhausting syringe. The lancet, surrounded by leather to keep air out of
the cup, could be supplemented by a cross with four additional blades, if
more than one puncture was desired.<small><a name="f134.1" id="f134.1" href="#f134">[134]</a></small> In 1819, Thomas Machell, a member
of the Royal College of Surgeons in London, described a similar apparatus
in which the glass cup was separated from the tin body of the apparatus by
a flexible tube. The facility and precision of the instrument, claimed
Machell, &#8220;are incalculably surpassed by the power of its application to
any part whatever of the surface, under any circumstances indicating its
propriety, and by any person untrained to the manual dexterity of a
professed cupper.&#8221;<small><a name="f135.1" id="f135.1" href="#f135">[135]</a></small></p>

<p>Professional cuppers who took pride in their skill naturally avoided such
novelties. Bayfield found the complex instruments objectionable because
even &#8220;the most trifling degree of injury is generally sufficient to render
the whole apparatus useless.&#8221;<small><a name="f136.1" id="f136.1" href="#f136">[136]</a></small></p>

<p>The Smithsonian collection contains two patent models of American wet
cupping devices. The first is an ingenious cupping set patented by a
Philadelphia navy surgeon, Robert J. Dodd, in 1844. It consisted of a
metal syringe provided with a plate of lancets that screwed on to a glass
tube with a protuberance for collecting blood. The most interesting
feature of the apparatus was the provision made for cupping internal parts
of the body such as the vagina, throat, or rectum. One could attach to the
pump either a curved or a straight tapering glass tube, seven to eight
inches long, and corresponding flexible metal lancet rod. The pump could
also be adapted for extracting milk from the breasts of women by attaching
a metal cap with a hole just large enough to accommodate the nipple.<small><a name="f137.1" id="f137.1" href="#f137">[137]</a></small>
The second patent model is that of W. D. Hooper of Liberty, Virginia, who
invented in 1867 an apparatus combining cup, pump, and scarificator. The
novel part of the instrument was the tubular blades that were injected
into the flesh and then left in place while the blood was being removed,
&#8220;by which means the punctures are kept from being closed prematurely, as
frequently happens with the ordinary device.&#8221;<small><a name="f138.1" id="f138.1" href="#f138">[138]</a></small></p>

<p>It is unlikely that any of these ingenious devices were marketed in
quantity. For those skilled in the art of cupping, the torch, cups, and
scarificator were more effective. For those not experienced in the art,
the new devices were simply too expensive, inconvenient to carry about,
and fragile. While doubtless some surgeons bought fancy equipment in order
to impress their patients, other surgeons, and the professional cuppers,
realized that expensive and unfamiliar gadgets could inspire more dread
than awe, especially among rural patients. The cupper Monson Hills advised
his readers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A person about to be cupped, is often needlessly alarmed by the
arrival of his operator, with a capacious box of instruments; and he
measures the severity of the pain he is about to undergo, by the
seeming multitude of instruments required to inflect it. If, on the
contrary, the few implements used are carried in the pocket, and
produced when about to be used, unobserved by the patient, this evil
is easily avoided.<small><a name="f139.1" id="f139.1" href="#f139">[139]</a></small></p></div>

<p>In seconding Hills&#8217; sentiments, W. A. Gillespie, the Virginia country
physician mentioned earlier, went a step further. Gillespie felt that the
rural physician could dispense with the glass cups, torch, and
scarificator and substitute in their place a simple thumb lancet and cow&#8217;s
horn. Not only would these instruments save money, but they would also
&#8220;excite less dread in the mind of the patient than a formidable display of
numerous and complicated instruments.&#8221;<small><a name="f140.1" id="f140.1" href="#f140">[140]</a></small></p>

<p>Some inventors concentrated on more modest improvements in cupping
technology, namely, modification of cups and scarificators. One of the
simplest improvements was that of Dr. Francis Fox, House Surgeon to the
Derbyshire General Dispensary. In 1827, Dr. Fox introduced a new glass cup
with a short, curved, wide neck and an oval belly that hung downwards.
When applied to the skin, the glass hung in the manner of a leech, and so
the glass was called &#8220;The Glass Leech.&#8221; Since the burning tow could be
placed in the hanging belly of the glass, away from the skin, it was
easier to apply and remove the ordinary cup.<small><a name="f141.1" id="f141.1" href="#f141">[141]</a></small> Other modifications of
the cupping cup included the addition of a stopcock to let the air back
in, graduations to measure the blood, and the attachment of a metal bar
inside the cup in order to hold the burning sponge or wick away from the
body of the patient.<small><a name="f142.1" id="f142.1" href="#f142">[142]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig15">15</a>.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>The most significant innovation in cups came with the manufacture of cups
of vulcanized rubber in the 1840s. Rubber cups could be easily exhausted
without need of a torch, and they were far cheaper and easier to
manipulate than cups attached to a pump. Most surgical catalogs in the
late nineteenth century offered both all-rubber cups and glass cups to
which a rubber bulb was attached. In the late nineteenth century, sets of
cups were sometimes sold with rubber rims because the rubber fit more
comfortably against the skin and prevented air from entering the cup.
Museum collections contain few rubber cups because nineteenth-century
rubber tended to deteriorate in time. However, the appearance of these
cups in all surgical catalogs indicates that they were widely sold.<small><a name="f143.1" id="f143.1" href="#f143">[143]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several inventors tried to improve upon the scarificator. The defects of
the ordinary scarificator were widely recognized. It was too bulky and
heavy, and it cost too much&mdash;the most inexpensive scarificator offered by
George Tiemann &amp; Co. in 1889 cost $4.50.<small><a name="f144.1" id="f144.1" href="#f144">[144]</a></small> A strong hand was required
to trigger the blades, and when the trigger was released, the force of the
spring was so great that the lever moved <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>back with great force and
produced a loud, unpleasant click. The force of the lever moving against
the case of the scarificator made it impossible to use any but expensive
materials (brass and German silver) in making the scarificator casing.
Furthermore, the springs were liable to break. Finally, the scarificator
was difficult to clean.<small><a name="f145.1" id="f145.1" href="#f145">[145]</a></small> Late in the century, when sterilization
became important, some cuppers went back to the lancet because the
scarificator could not be surgically cleansed. The surprising thing is,
that despite all the defects, the same scarificator was sold in 1930 as in
1830. Either the claims of the inventors of improved scarificators were
unjustified, or cuppers were unwilling to try novel instruments in what
was becoming an old-fashioned and increasingly less popular operation.
(Figure <a href="#fig16">16</a>.)</p>

<p>A few British and American surgical supply companies sold special models
of scarificator, but always in addition to the common scarificator. The
special models were generally higher in price. For example, the
Englishman, James Coxeter, announced in 1845 a new scarificator with a
rotating lever on the side instead of a cocking lever on the top. The
roto-lever, according to Coxeter, could be turned to set the scarificator
by a child of six. Furthermore, the scarificator was so constructed that
when the spring was released only internal parts moved. There was no lever
that snapped back and no resounding click. This special model of
scarificator continued to be sold by Coxeter and Son (London) until late
in the nineteenth century.<small><a name="f146.1" id="f146.1" href="#f146">[146]</a></small></p>

<p>Coxeter did not patent the roto-lever scarificator. In fact, through 1852
there were no British patents on scarificators. In contrast, there were
eight French patents on scarificators before 1860.<small><a name="f147.1" id="f147.1" href="#f147">[147]</a></small> Of these, the most
important was the 1841 patent of Joseph-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric-Benoit Charri&egrave;re
(1803-<ins class="correction" title="Presented as in the original.">1973</ins>), a Swiss-born cutler who founded a major surgical supply
company in Paris. Charri&egrave;re&#8217;s octagonal scarificator substituted two flat
coiled springs (like watch springs) for the two cantilever springs
normally found in &#8220;reversible&#8221; scarificators. One end of each coiled
spring was attached to the scarificator casing and the other to one of the
support rods. As the cocking lever was pulled, the support rods turned and
wound the springs more tightly about the rods. According to Charri&egrave;re,
these springs were more efficient and less likely to break than the
ordinary springs.<small><a name="f148.1" id="f148.1" href="#f148">[148]</a></small></p>

<p>Charri&egrave;re&#8217;s company later employed the coiled springs in the making of a
circular scarificator. The circular scarificators, associated particularly
with French manufacture, were the most elegant of nineteenth-century
scarificators and a fitting complement to the Charri&egrave;re cupping sets.<small><a name="f149.1" id="f149.1" href="#f149">[149]</a></small>
They were generally not sold by British and American surgical supply
companies, but a number of them appear to have reached the hands of
American physicians.</p>

<p>In America, there were five patents on scarificators, of which the
Smithsonian possesses three patent models. The most significant American
patent was that of George Tiemann in 1846. Tiemann&#8217;s scarificator had a
flattened base and an ebony handle, which contained a coiled spring. The
blades were moved by a rack and pinion mechanism, and triggered by a knob
at the end of the handle. The advantages claimed by the inventor were ease
in handling, ease in cleaning, and the diagonal cut of the blades that
allowed the blood to flow more freely and the wounds to heal more readily.
Tiemann &amp; Co. was still selling their patent scarificator as late as 1889
for a price of $7.00.<small><a name="f150.1" id="f150.1" href="#f150">[150]</a></small> The Smithsonian possesses a marketed version in
addition to the patent model.</p>

<p>The two other patent scarificators in the Smithsonian collection were both
invented by Frederick M. Leypoldt of Philadelphia. The first, patented in
1847, was similar in external appearance to the common scarificator. The
novelty consisted of a new arrangement of the cocking lever and cantilever
spring that allowed use of a lighter and cheaper casing. Although the
patent model was made of brass, Leypoldt claimed that with his
improvements in the internal mechanism, the case could, with safety, be
made of tin.<small><a name="f151.1" id="f151.1" href="#f151">[151]</a></small></p>

<p>Leypoldt&#8217;s second patent, issued in 1851, was for a scarificator with a
greatly simplified inner mechanism allowing for a substantially smaller
and lighter case. The cocking lever was placed horizontally in the casing
and engaged the blade rods through a rack and pinion mechanism. According
to Leypoldt, this scarificator was more convenient, more portable,
cheaper, safer, and more reliable than the common scarificator.<small><a name="f152.1" id="f152.1" href="#f152">[152]</a></small>
Leypoldt probably marketed his scarificators, there being in the
Smithsonian collection other bloodletting instruments with his name, but
he did not form a major surgical supply company as did George Tiemann.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>After 1860, interest in inventing new scarificators declined as wet
cupping decreased in popularity. The improved cups and scarificators,
while they had achieved a limited success, had still failed to supplant
the common octagonal scarificator and the plain glass cup. As interest in
wet cupping declined, medical attention shifted to the therapeutic virtues
of dry cupping. Dry cupping offered even greater opportunities for
inventors, who sought means to bring the effects of the vacuum to more
areas of the body for greater lengths of time.</p>


<p><br /><i>Dry Cupping</i></p>

<p>Dry cupping, in its simplest form, was said to act as a &#8220;revulsive&#8221; or
&#8220;derivant.&#8221; By the nineteenth century these once hotly debated terms had
become nearly interchangeable in discussions of cupping. In cupping for
revulsive purposes, one cupped on a distant part to relieve excess of
blood in the affected part. In applying cupping as a &#8220;derivant,&#8221; one
cupped closer to the affected part. In either case, the source of pain was
presumed to be somewhere below the skin, and the pain was relieved by
bringing blood away from the affected part to the surface of the body.
Thus, one nineteenth-century cupper concluded, revulsion was only
derivation at a distant point.<small><a name="f153.1" id="f153.1" href="#f153">[153]</a></small></p>

<p>If dry cupping was applied for ten minutes or longer so that the
capillaries burst, the action of the cups was said to be that of a
counter-irritant. According to ancient medical theory, the
counter-irritant was a means of relieving an affected part by deliberately
setting up a secondary inflammation or a running sore in another part.
Counter-irritations were traditionally produced in a number of ways, among
them, blisters, cautery, setons, moxa, and dry cupping.<small><a name="f154.1" id="f154.1" href="#f154">[154]</a></small></p>

<p>One of the most popular counter-irritation devices commonly associated
with cupping instruments in catalogs of surgical goods, was Baunscheidt&#8217;s
<i>Lebenswecker</i>, sold by most American surgical supply houses in the second
half of the nineteenth century. The <i>Lebenswecker</i>, or &#8220;Awakener of Life,&#8221;
was the mainstay of the mystical medical system known as
<i>Baunscheidtismus</i>, after the founder of the device, Carl Baunscheidt of
Prussia (1809-1860).<small><a name="f155.1" id="f155.1" href="#f155">[155]</a></small> The system apparently gained much notoriety in
Germany, England, and America, for Baunscheidt&#8217;s book went through ten
German editions and several British and American editions. At least two
Americans patented improvements on the <i>Lebenswecker</i>.<small><a name="f156.1" id="f156.1" href="#f156">[156]</a></small> The device was
made of ebony, about 250 mm long, and contained a coiled spring attached
to a handle. At the other end of the spring was a place about 20 mm in
diameter, with about thirty projecting needles. By pushing upon the
handle, one sent the needles into the skin. The ability of the instrument
to create blisters was enhanced by the application of Baunscheidt&#8217;s
special oil to the irritation (Figure <a href="#fig17">17</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Dry cupping stimulated much theoretical debate in the nineteenth century
as well as a number of physiological experiments.<small><a name="f157.1" id="f157.1" href="#f157">[157]</a></small> Although physicians
generally agreed that dry cupping had curative value if employed properly,
they disagreed widely on when to employ the remedy, and on the manner in
which the remedy operated. Did application of cups affect only the surface
vessels, or could cupping affect the entire nervous system, and through
the nerves, the action of the secretory organs? Were the effects of dry
cupping of only a temporary nature, or were they permanent? An interesting
series of investigations in Europe and America sought to ascertain the
value of dry cupping in checking the absorption of poison. An American,
Dr. Casper Wistar Pennock, replying to investigations performed by Martin
Barry, an Edinburgh physician residing in Paris, carried out an impressive
series of physiological experiments in 1827, in which he administered
strychnine and arsenic under the skin of dogs and rabbits and then cupped
over the wounds. He concluded that while dry cupping prevented almost
certain death from the poisons, once the cups were removed, death would
ensue, unless the poisons were surgically removed.<small><a name="f158.1" id="f158.1" href="#f158">[158]</a></small></p>

<p>Interest in dry cupping led to attempts to apply the therapeutic effects
of the operation to larger areas of the body than could be accommodated by
a cup. In France, Victor-Th&eacute;odore Junod (1809-1881) adapted cupping to
entire limbs. Shortly after receiving his degree in medicine in 1833,
Junod presented at the Academy of Sciences his apparatus, known thereafter
as Junod&#8217;s boot. Junod believed that actual extraction of blood was a
dangerous remedy and that the benefits of bleeding might as easily be
obtained by his &#8220;derivative method,&#8221; which withdrew blood from the general
circulation but allowed it to be returned at will. Junod&#8217;s boot and
Junod&#8217;s arm, which sold for as much as $25.00 apiece,<small><a name="f159.1" id="f159.1" href="#f159">[159]</a></small> were
constructed of metal and secured against the limb by a silk, and later a
rubber, cap. To the boot was attached a flexible tube, stopcock, pump, and
if desired, a manometer for measuring the vacuum produced. In chronic
illnesses, Junod recommended that the boot be applied for an hour. So much
blood was withdrawn from the circulation by use of the apparatus that the
patient might easily faint. To explain how his boot worked, Junod invented
a theory that he called &#8220;hemospasia,&#8221; meaning the drawing of blood.<small><a name="f160.1" id="f160.1" href="#f160">[160]</a></small>
This was typical of a number of attempts to introduce sophisticated
terminology into discussions of traditional remedies. Junod&#8217;s arm and boot
were widely available through American surgical supply companies. As late
as 1915, Heinrich Stern, previously mentioned as a latter-day proponent of
bloodletting, had no doubt that application of the boot to the foot would
relieve congested states of the abdominal viscera.<small><a name="f161.1" id="f161.1" href="#f161">[161]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig18">18</a>.)</p>

<p>Americans patented a number of modifications of the arm and boot, and in
addition they patented a number of whole body devices called &#8220;depurators.&#8221;
Junod had introduced such a device along with his boot&mdash;a metal casing in
which a patient would be placed leaving only his face showing. The air
inside would then be exhausted by means of a gigantic syringe. In America
such &#8220;depurators&#8221; may have been regarded more as quackery than as a
legitimate extension of cupping, for despite the fact that Americans
patented some twenty of these devices, surgical supply houses did not sell
them and little was written about them.</p>

<p>In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Dr. August Bier, professor
at the University of Bonn, developed another sophisticated theory
supporting the use of blood-suction devices, known as the theory of
hyperemia, meaning &#8220;excess of blood.&#8221; According to the doctrine, lesions
are always accompanied in nature by hyperemia, &#8220;the most widespread of
auto-curative agents.&#8221;<small><a name="f162.1" id="f162.1" href="#f162">[162]</a></small> If we, therefore, wish to imitate nature, we
create an artificial hyperemia. Bier recommended several means of
increasing the blood supply of an affected part, including hot-air baths,
suction devices such as Junod&#8217;s boot, and dry cupping. Several American
surgical suppliers sold Bier&#8217;s Hyperemic Cups in the early twentieth
century. These were glass cups, of a great variety of shapes and sizes
including some with curved rims, each fitted with a rubber tube and bulb
for exhausting the air. A major function of these cups was to collect
wound secretions from boils or furuncles.<small><a name="f163.1" id="f163.1" href="#f163">[163]</a></small></p>

<p><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><i>Breast Cupping</i></p>

<p>Related to cupping by its technology is the practice of drawing milk from
the breasts by means of breast pumps. Mothers with underdeveloped or
inflamed breasts posed a frequent problem for the nineteenth-century
physician, who treated them with either large doses of tartar emetic, a
strong purgative, or with cupping.<small><a name="f164.1" id="f164.1" href="#f164">[164]</a></small> Breast pumps were small glass cups
with fluted edges made to accommodate the nipple. While some surgeons, as
the American Samuel Gross, recommended using a bottle with a long neck in
which the air had been rarified by means of hot water,<small><a name="f165.1" id="f165.1" href="#f165">[165]</a></small> most breast
pumps were exhausted by mechanical means. For reasons of modesty, the
pumps were usually designed so that the woman could draw her breasts
herself. Perhaps the simplest design of a breast pump was a glass cup
having a long spout extending in such a way that the woman could perform
suction herself. Such all-glass cups were illustrated in the eighteenth
century.<small><a name="f166.1" id="f166.1" href="#f166">[166]</a></small> A few, reputedly made centuries earlier, are found in the
Wellcome Historical Medical Museum. Early in the nineteenth century,
breast pumps, just as glass cups for bleeding, were attached to brass
syringes, and were often included among the variety of cups in cupping
sets provided with syringes. Read&#8217;s and Weiss&#8217;s patent syringe as well as
Thomas Machell&#8217;s cupping device were adapted for breast pumping. With the
invention of vulcanized rubber, the breast pump was frequently attached to
a large rubber bulb. A glass protuberance was often added to pumps
exhausted by syringes or rubber bulbs, in order to collect the milk so
that it could be fed to the infant. In the 1920s some breast pumps were
attached to electric motors.<small><a name="f167.1" id="f167.1" href="#f167">[167]</a></small> Breast pumps have continued to be
employed up to the present day. Of all instruments employing the principle
of the cupping device, breast pumps were the most frequently patented.
From 1834 to 1975, more than 60 breast pumps were patented, the majority
in the period from 1860 to 1920.<small><a name="f168.1" id="f168.1" href="#f168">[168]</a></small></p>


<p><br /><i>The Decline of Cupping</i></p>

<p>Cupping died out in America in the early twentieth century, but its
disappearance was gradual and scarcely noticed. Some of the most complex
of cupping devices were invented in a period when most physicians regarded
cupping as ineffectual. Patents for cupping devices continued to be issued
as late as 1916 when Joel A. Maxam of Idaho Springs, Colorado, patented a
motorized pump, which by means of various sizes of cups, could subject a
part of the patient&#8217;s body to either a prolonged suction or a prolonged
compression.<small><a name="f169.1" id="f169.1" href="#f169">[169]</a></small> One of America&#8217;s last advocates of bloodletting,
Heinrich Stern, writing in 1915, also advocated the use of an electrical
suction pump to evacuate cups. With an electric motor, he declared, one
could prolong hyperemia for 15, 30, or more minutes.</p>

<p>Stern also invented a theory to account for the therapeutic effects of his
inventions, namely, the theory of phlebostasis. Instead of pumping air out
of a device, Stern pumped air into a device, for the same purpose of
removing a portion of blood from the general circulation. His
&#8220;phlebostate,&#8221; manufactured by Kny-Scheerer of New York, was quite similar
to a sphygmomanometer. It consisted of a set of cuffs that fit about the
thighs, rubber tubes, a manometer, and a suction bulb or an electric force
pump. For stubborn cases, such as migraine headaches, Stern recommended
using the cuffs for 30 minutes or more. To facilitate the application of
the cuffs, Stern invented a &#8220;phlebostasis chair,&#8221; one of the most complex
&#8220;cupping&#8221; devices ever made. Like an electric chair, the phlebostasis
chair was supplied with cuffs for both arms and legs. Air was pumped into
the cuffs by means of an electric motor. According to Stern, compression
of the upper segment of both arms withheld 300 cc of blood from
circulation, while compression of the thighs withheld as much as 600
cc.<small><a name="f170.1" id="f170.1" href="#f170">[170]</a></small></p>

<p>In addition to these sophisticated devices, simple cupping, especially dry
cupping, continued well into the 1930s. Although cupping was no longer
generally recommended by physicians, most surgical companies advertised
cups, scarificators, and cupping sets in the 1920s and even the 1930s. The
last bastions of cupping in the United States were the immigrant sections
of large cities. In the lower East Side of New York, in particular,
cupping was still flourishing in the 1920s. By then cupping was no longer
performed by the physician, but had been relegated back to the lowly
barber, who advertised in his shop window, &#8220;Cups for Colds.&#8221;<small><a name="f171.1" id="f171.1" href="#f171">[171]</a></small></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Leeching</h3>

<p><i>Leeches</i></p>

<p>The word &#8220;leech&#8221; derives from the Anglo-Saxon <i>loece</i>, &#8220;to heal.&#8221; Thus,
the Anglo-Saxon physician was called a &#8220;leech&#8221; and his textbook of
therapeutic methods a &#8220;leechdom.&#8221; The animal itself was already known to
the ancients under its Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> name <i>hirudino</i>. It appears, however, that
the introduction of leeches into Western medicine came somewhat later than
that of phlebotomy or cupping, for Hippocrates made no mention of them.
The earliest references to the use of leeches in medicine are found in
Nicander of Colophon (2nd century <span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>) and in Themison (1st century
<span class="smcaplc">B.C.</span>). Thereafter they were mentioned by most Greek, Roman, and Arabic
medical writers.<small><a name="f172.1" id="f172.1" href="#f172">[172]</a></small></p>

<p>The leech is a fresh-water parasitic invertebrate belonging to the Phylum
Annelida. On one end of its worm-like body is a large sucker by which the
animal fastens itself to the ground, and at the other end is a smaller
sucker, in the middle of which is a chitinous mouth that makes a
triangular puncture. As items of <i>materia medica</i>, leeches were described
in dispensatories, or compilations of medicaments, and sold by
apothecaries, both to physicians and directly to patients. The species
most commonly used for bleeding was <i>Hirudo medicinalis</i>, indigenous to
the streams and swamps of Central and Northern Europe, and known in
commerce as the Swedish or German leech. It was 50-75 mm long, with a dull
olive green back and four yellow longitudinal lines, the central two
broken with black. Somewhat less popular was the Hungarian leech,
indigenous to Southern Europe. In addition, there was an American species
of leech, <i>Hirudo decora</i>, which was gathered principally from the lower
Delaware River, but, since it drew much less blood than the Swedish leech,
it was regarded as greatly inferior.<small><a name="f173.1" id="f173.1" href="#f173">[173]</a></small> Most American physicians
imported their leeches. In the late nineteenth century, one could buy
Swedish leeches for $5.00 per hundred.<small><a name="f174.1" id="f174.1" href="#f174">[174]</a></small></p>

<p>Leeches were gathered in the spring of the year either by means of a pole
net, or, more primitively, by wading into the water and allowing the
leeches to fasten themselves onto the legs. Sometimes horses and cattle
were driven into the water to serve as bait for the leeches.<small><a name="f175.1" id="f175.1" href="#f175">[175]</a></small>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>Leeching, like other forms of bloodletting, enjoyed a revival in the early
nineteenth century, particularly in France, where the doctrines of heroic
medicine preached by Broussais<small><a name="f176.1" id="f176.1" href="#f176">[176]</a></small> led to an increase of leech usage from
about 3 million in 1824 to 41.5 million in 1833.<small><a name="f177.1" id="f177.1" href="#f177">[177]</a></small> Leechers, although
not as high in status as professional cuppers, practiced in many large
cities, and numerous tracts were written on the care and breeding of
leeches. &#8220;Leech farms&#8221; were unable to increase the leech supply to meet
the rising demand, and most leechers complained of the scarcity and great
expense of the little animals.<small><a name="f178.1" id="f178.1" href="#f178">[178]</a></small></p>

<p>Leeching and cupping each had their advocates. The major advantage of the
leech over the cup was that the leech could be employed on almost any part
of the anatomy, including around the eyes, in the mouth, the anus, and the
vagina. In fact, leeching the internal membranes enjoyed quite a vogue in
the early nineteenth century. Leeches were applied to the larynx and the
trachea for bronchitis and laryngitis and for relieving the cough of
phthisis. For inflammations of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the
eyelids) they were applied to the nasal membrances of the adjacent
nostril, and for inflammations of the ear they were applied to the meatus
of the ear and behind the ear. The French popularized the practice of
leeching the anus to treat inflammations of the mucous membranes of the
bowel. To prevent leeches from getting lost in the body cavities, Jonathan
Osborne, a British physician, recommended in 1833 that a thread should be
passed through the leech&#8217;s tail. In addition, he invented a device, which
he called a &#8220;polytome,&#8221; specifically for introducing leeches into the
rectum.<small><a name="f179.1" id="f179.1" href="#f179">[179]</a></small> In the mid-nineteenth century, special leech tubes were
widely sold for applying leeches to internal membranes.<small><a name="f180.1" id="f180.1" href="#f180">[180]</a></small></p>

<p>A second advantage of leeches over cupping was that leeches could extract
blood more readily. Not only was dexterity not required in order to apply
a leech, but also it was soon noticed that leech bites continued to bleed
even after the leech let go, while scarificator incisions often coagulated
before any blood was obtained. In 1884 it was shown by John Berry
Haycroft, a Birmingham chemist, that this phenomenon was due to an
anti-coagulant, now called &#8220;hirudin,&#8221; that the leech injected into the
blood.<small><a name="f181.1" id="f181.1" href="#f181">[181]</a></small></p>

<p>To apply a leech, the animal was first dried with a bit of linen, and the
skin of the patient was prepared by washing with warm water and then
shaving. To direct it to the right spot, the leech was often placed in a
small wine glass that was inverted over the area to be bitten. Since
leeches were sometimes perversely unwilling to bite, they were enticed by
the placement of a bit of milk or blood on the patient&#8217;s skin. Small
children were given one or two leeches, and adults 20 or more. Broussais
employed up to 50 leeches at one time.<small><a name="f182.1" id="f182.1" href="#f182">[182]</a></small> The leech was usually allowed
to drop off of its own accord when it had satiated itself, which took
about an hour. Sometimes the tail of the leech was cut off so that it
would continue to suck. Once used, leeches could not be reused for several
months unless they were made to disgorge their meal by dropping them in
salt water or weak vinegar. A healthy leech drew one or two fluid drachms
of blood, and as much would flow after the leech had dropped off. Thus a
good Swedish leech could remove about an ounce of blood. This quantity
could be increased by employing a cupping glass over the bite.<small><a name="f183.1" id="f183.1" href="#f183">[183]</a></small></p>

<p>Leeches were kept in a glass container of water covered with gauze or
muslin and placed in a cool, dark room. The water had to be changed
frequently, as much as every other day in summer. Pebbles or moss were
placed in the bottom of the vessel to aid the leech in removing the slimy
epidermis that it shed every four or five days. In the nineteenth century
leeches were often sold in drug stores from large, elegant containers with
perforated caps. Actually, only the day&#8217;s supply of the pharmacist&#8217;s
leeches was kept in the attractive storefront jars; the rest were kept out
of sight. While most leech jars were simple white crockery pieces with
&#8220;leeches&#8221; lettered in black on the front, some leech jars were over two
feet tall and decorated with elegant floral and scroll work. Among the
most ornate leech jars were those made in Staffordshire, England.<small><a name="f184.1" id="f184.1" href="#f184">[184]</a></small>
(Figure <a href="#fig20">20</a>.)</p>


<p><br /><i>Artificial Leeches</i></p>

<p>One of the characteristics of nineteenth-century technology was the
attempt to replace natural materials and processes by imitations and
mechanisms. Considering the properties of the natural leech, it is no
wonder that very early in the nineteenth century inventors began to seek a
mechanical substitute. The disadvantages of the leech were many. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Wrote
one inventor of an artificial leech:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the first place the appearance of the animal is repulsive and
disgusting, and delicate and sensitive persons find it difficult to
overcome their repugnance to contact with the cold and slimy reptile.
This is especially the case when it is a question of their
application about or within the mouth. Then again, their disposition
to crawl into cavities or passages results sometimes in very annoying
accidents. Another source of annoyance is that they are often
unwilling to bite&mdash;the patience of all concerned being exhausted in
fruitless efforts to induce them to take hold.</p>

<p>The expense, too, of a considerable number is by no means
trifling.<small><a name="f185.1" id="f185.1" href="#f185">[185]</a></small></p></div>

<p><a name="fig20" id="fig20"></a>&nbsp;</p>

263554 [M-11504]; SI photo 73-4231.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, leeches were often difficult to obtain, and the rural
physician could not easily carry them about. Leech bites could have
unfortunate consequences, for many times the bleeding could not be
stopped. For these and other reasons, several inventors in Europe and
America sought to create a mechanical or artificial leech.<small><a name="f186.1" id="f186.1" href="#f186">[186]</a></small> Such
artificial leeches are often difficult to distinguish from cupping
devices, because both sorts of instruments employed some form of
scarification and suction. Artificial leeches however, were usually
adaptable to small areas of the anatomy, and the puncture wound generally
attempted to imitate a leech bite.</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest instrument offered as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> substitute for leeches was
Sarlandi&egrave;re&#8217;s &#8220;bdellometer,&#8221; from the Greek <i>bdello</i>, &#8220;leech.&#8221;
Sarlandi&egrave;re, a French manufacturer, introduced his instrument in 1819 and,
incidentally, had the prototype sent to New Orleans. The bdellometer
consisted of a glass bell with two protruding tubes, one perpendicular for
performing scarification, and the other oblique, for attaching the
aspirating pump. A plug could be removed to allow air to enter the bell
after the operation was completed, and a faucet allowed for drainage of
blood without having to remove the apparatus from the body. A curved
<ins class="correction" title="original: canula">cannula</ins> could be attached to the bdellometer for bleeding in the nasal
passages, the mouth, the vagina, and the rectum. For internal
bloodletting, the disk, with lancets, normally used for scarification, was
replaced by a small brush of hog bristles.<small><a name="f187.1" id="f187.1" href="#f187">[187]</a></small> Sarlandi&egrave;re&#8217;s bdellometer
attracted sufficient attention in America to be included in the numerous
editions of Robley Dunglison&#8217;s medical dictionary,<small><a name="f188.1" id="f188.1" href="#f188">[188]</a></small> but it was
ultimately no more successful than the complicated cupping devices
discussed in the previous chapter.</p>

<p>A second French invention, also given a pretentious name, was Damoiseau&#8217;s
&#8220;terabdella&#8221; (meaning &#8220;large leech&#8221;), or pneumatic leech. This invention,
introduced some time before 1862, met with skepticism at the outset on the
part of the reviewers at the French Academy of Medicine. It consisted of
two pistons attached to a plate to be placed on the floor and held down by
the feet of the operator. Each piston was connected by a tube to a cup,
and the whole apparatus was operated by means of a hand lever connected
with both pistons. More a cupping device than an artificial leech, the
terabdella met with little success beyond the French province where
Damoiseau practiced.<small><a name="f189.1" id="f189.1" href="#f189">[189]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig21">21</a>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most successful of the mechanical leeches was known as
Heurteloup&#8217;s leech, after its inventor, the Frenchman, Charles Louis
Heurteloup (1793-1864). Sold in most late nineteenth-century surgical
catalogs for as much as $15.00, the device consisted of two parts, one a
spring scarificator that made a small circular incision (about 5 mm in
diameter) and the other, a suction pump, holding an ounce of blood, whose
piston was raised by means of a screw. For the treatment of eye ailments,
one of the major purposes for which the device was invented, it was
applied to the temples.<small><a name="f190.1" id="f190.1" href="#f190">[190]</a></small> A similar two-part mechanical leech was sold
under the name &#8220;Luer&#8217;s Leech.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most interesting leech substitutes, sold by George Teimann &amp;
Co. as its &#8220;Patent Artificial Leech,&#8221; employed ether in exhausting the
glass &#8220;leeches.&#8221; Patented by F. A. Stohlmann and A. H. Smith of New York
in 1870, the &#8220;leech&#8221; consisted of a glass tube, either straight or with a
mouth on the side so that the tube would hang somewhat like a living
leech. To expel air from the tube, a few drops of ether were placed in it,
after which it was immersed to its mouth in hot water until the ether
vaporized. The tube was then applied to the skin and allowed to cool, thus
sucking blood from a wound made by the scarificator, a long metal tube
that was rotated to make a circular incision. One of the patentees
explained the advantages of the device:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In all previous attempts at an artificial leech the vacuum has been
produced by the action of a piston. This renders the instrument too
heavy to retain its position, and necessitates its constantly being
held. This precludes the application of any number at once, even if
the cost of half-a-dozen such instruments were left out of the
account. But in the case of this leech, the tubes, being exceedingly
light, attach themselves at once, remaining in position until filled;
and as the cost of them is but a few cents, there is no limit to the
number which may be applied.<small><a name="f191.1" id="f191.1" href="#f191">[191]</a></small></p></div>

<p>To take the place of leeches in the uterus, quite a number of uterine
scarificators were sold. These were generally simple puncturing
instruments without spring mechanisms. If insufficient blood flowed from
the scarification, Thomas&#8217;s Dry Cupper, a widely available vulcanite
syringe, could be inserted into the vagina to cup the cervix before
puncturing.<small><a name="f192.1" id="f192.1" href="#f192">[192]</a></small> At least one attempt was made to combine puncture and
suction in a device for uterine application. This was Dr. William Reese&#8217;s
&#8220;Uterine Leech,&#8221; introduced in 1876. It consisted of a graduated glass
cylinder 190 mm long and 12 mm in diameter containing a piston and a rod
with a spear point. The rod was surrounded by a spring that withdrew the
blade after it punctured the cervix. Several American companies, including
George Tiemann &amp; Co., offered the device for sale.<small><a name="f193.1" id="f193.1" href="#f193">[193]</a></small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite all the efforts to find a suitable substitute, the use of natural
leeches persisted until the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>practice of local bloodletting gradually
disappeared in America. By the 1920s leeches were difficult to find except
in pharmacies in immigrant sections of large cities like New York or
Boston. One of the last ailments to be regularly treated by leeches was
the common black eye. Leeches commanded rather high prices in the 1920s,
if they could be found at all. One Brooklyn pharmacist, who deliberately
kept an old-fashioned drugstore with the motto &#8220;No Cigars, No Candy, No
Ice Cream, No Soda Water, But I Do Sell Pure Medicines,&#8221; wrote in 1923:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here in this atmosphere free from the lunch room odor my
armamentarium consists of drugs and preparations from the vegetable,
mineral and animal kingdoms. Among the latter are leeches,
prominently displayed in a number of glass jars in different parts of
the store, including one in the show window. Anything moving,
anything odd, arouses the curiosity of the public, and my reputation
as a &#8220;leecher&#8221; has spread far beyond the &#8220;City of Churches.&#8221; Besides,
this leech business is also profitable, as they are retailed at $1.00
per head without any trouble; in fact patients are only too glad to
be able to obtain them.<small><a name="f194.1" id="f194.1" href="#f194">[194]</a></small></p></div>

<h3>Veterinary Bloodletting</h3>

<p>The same theories and practices that prevailed for human medicine were
applied to the treatment of animals. Not only were horses routinely bled,
they were also cupped and leeched.<small><a name="f195.1" id="f195.1" href="#f195">[195]</a></small> Manuals of veterinary medicine
gave instructions for the bleeding of horses, cows, sheep, pigs, dogs, and
cats.<small><a name="f196.1" id="f196.1" href="#f196">[196]</a></small></p>

<p>There was one major difference between bleeding a man and bleeding a horse
or cow, and that was the amount of strength required to open a vein. The
considerable force needed to pierce the skin and the tunic of the blood
vessel made the operation much more difficult to perform than human
phlebotomy.<small><a name="f197.1" id="f197.1" href="#f197">[197]</a></small> As in the case of cupping, the simplest instruments,
those most often recommended by experts, were not easy to use by those
without experience. Although a larger version of the thumb lancet was
sometimes employed, most veterinarians opened the vein of a horse with a
fleam, that is, an instrument in which the blade (commonly double beveled)
was set at right angles to the blade stem. These are enlarged versions of
the fleam employed in human bloodletting. The fleams sold in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries consisted of one or more blades that
folded out of a fitted brass shield. In the late nineteenth century fleams
with horn shields were also sold. The largest blades were to be used to
open the deeper veins and the smaller blades to open the more superficial
veins.</p>

<p>To force the fleam into the vein, one employed a bloodstick, a stick 35-38
cm long and 2 cm in diameter. The blade was held against the vein and a
blow was given to the back of the blade with the stick in such a way that
the fleam penetrated but did not go through the vein. Immediately the
fleam was removed and a jet of blood came forth that was caught and
measured in a container. When enough blood had been collected, a needle
would be placed in the vein to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>Horses were most frequently bled from the jugular vein in the neck, but
also from veins in the thigh, the fold at the junction of breast and
forelegs, the spur, the foreleg, the palate, and the toe.</p>

<p>Since applying the bloodstick required a degree of skill, the Germans
attempted to eliminate its use by adapting the spring lancet to veterinary
medicine. The common veterinary spring lancet (which sometimes was also
called a &#8220;fleam&#8221; or &#8220;phleme&#8221;) was nothing but an oversized version of the
brass, nob end spring lancet used on humans. Sometimes the lancet was
provided with a blade guard that served to regulate the amount of blade
that penetrated the skin. Although the veterinary spring lancet was quite
popular in some quarters, the French preferred the simple foldout fleam as
a more convenient instrument.<small><a name="f198.1" id="f198.1" href="#f198">[198]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig22">22</a>.)</p>

<p class="note"><span class="smcap">Figure 22.</span>&mdash;Knob end spring lancet used on humans compared
to a knob end lancet used on horses and cattle. Note the blade guard on
the veterinary spring lancet. (NMHT 302606.09 and NMHT 218383 [M-9256]: SI
photo 76-7757.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast to the few attempts made to modify the human spring lancet,
there were a large number of attempts to modify the veterinary spring
lancets. Veterinary spring lancets can be found with a wide assortment of
shapes and a wide variety of spring mechanisms. In the enlarged knob end
spring lancet, pushing upon the lever release simply sent the blade
forward into the skin. By a more complex mechanism, the blade could be
made to return after it was injected, or the blade could be made to sweep
out a curve as do the blades of the scarificator. Perhaps one of the
earliest attempts to introduce a more complex internal mechanism into the
veterinary spring lancets is found in John Weiss&#8217;s &#8220;patent horse phlemes&#8221;
of 1828. The first model invented by Weiss was constructed on the
principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> of the common fleam and bloodstick. As in the knob end spring
lancet, the spring acted as a hammer to drive the blade forward. In a
second improved &#8220;horse phleme,&#8221; Weiss mounted the blade on a pivot so that
the blade swept out a semicircle when the spring was released.<small><a name="f199.1" id="f199.1" href="#f199">[199]</a></small></p>

<p>The Smithsonian collection contains a number of different types of
veterinary spring lancets. Perhaps this variety can best be illustrated by
looking at the two patent models in the collection. The first is an
oval-shaped lancet patented in 1849 by Joseph Ives of Bristol,
Connecticut.<small><a name="f200.1" id="f200.1" href="#f200">[200]</a></small> By using a wheel and axle mechanism, Ives had the blade
sweep out an eccentric curve. The lancet was set by a detachable key
(Figure <a href="#fig23">23</a>).</p>

<p>The second patent lancet was even more singular in appearance, having the
shape of a gun. This instrument, patented by Hermann Reinhold and August
Schreiber of Davenport, Iowa, in 1880, featured a cocking lever that
extended to form a coiled spring in the handle portion of the gun. Also
attached to the cocking lever was an extended blade with <ins class="correction" title="original: rachet">ratchet</ins> catches,
so that by pulling on the cocking lever, the blade was brought inside the
casing and the spring placed under tension. Pushing upon the trigger then
shot the blade into the vein.<small><a name="f201.1" id="f201.1" href="#f201">[201]</a></small> (Figure <a href="#fig24">24</a>.)</p>

<h3>Physical Analysis of Artifacts</h3>

<p>The Conservation Analytical Laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution
analyzed selected bloodletting instruments and one drawing from the
Museum&#8217;s collection. Instruments were chosen on the basis of their unique
appearance and as representative examples of the major types of
instruments in the collection. Six lancets and cases, two scarificators,
and one pen and ink drawing were analyzed.</p>

<p>X-ray fluorescence analysis, response to a magnet, reaction to nitric
acid, and the Vickers pyramid hardness test were among the methods of
analysis used that involved no damage to the objects.</p>

<p>The instrument for X-ray fluorescence analysis has been modified to permit
analysis of selected areas on the objects. This instrument produces,
detects, and records the object&#8217;s X-ray fluorescence spectrum, which is
characteristic of its composition. X-rays produced by a target in the
instrument strike the object and cause it, in turn, to fluoresce, or emit,
X-rays. This fluorescence is detected by a silicon crystal in the detector
and dispersed into a spectrum, which is displayed on an <ins class="correction" title="original: ocilloscipe">oscilloscope</ins>
screen. The entire spectrum&mdash;from 0 to 40 Ke V&mdash;can be displayed or
portions of it can be expanded and displayed at an apparently higher
resolution that permits differentiation between closely spaced fluorescent
peaks, such as those from iron and manganese. The spectrum may be
transferred from the oscilloscope to a computer for calculation of the
percentage of composition and for comparison with spectra of other
samples. During analysis the objects can be supported and masked by sheets
of plexiglas or metal foils to limit the radiation to a certain area of
the object. Masks also prevent scattering of radiation off other parts of
the object and off the instrument itself, which otherwise might be
detected and interpreted as less concentrated components in the object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Brass was the most common metal used in the fabrication of eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century lancets and scarificators. Upon analysis the brass was
found to contain 70%-75% copper, 20%-30% zinc, and other trace elements.
The blades, cocking levers, and button releases of lancets and
scarificators were found to be made of ferrous metal (iron or steel). In
addition to the typical brass pieces, a number of &#8220;white metal&#8221; pieces
were analyzed. (The term &#8220;white metal&#8221; is used to designate any
undetermined silver-colored metal alloy.) Those white metal pieces dating
from the eighteenth century (a Swiss or Tyrolean fleam and an English
veterinary spring lancet) were found to be composed entirely of ferrous
metal. The hardness of the fleam metal indicated that it was carburized
sufficiently to be made of steel. Two of the spring lancets, dating from
the late nineteenth century, were found to be made of a silver-copper
composition that was not rich enough in silver to be sterling silver.
These lancets were probably typical of the lancets advertised as silver in
the late nineteenth-century trade catalogs. About 1850 an alloy imitating
silver began to be widely used in the making of surgical instruments. This
was German silver or nickel-silver, an alloy containing no silver at all,
but rather copper, zinc, and nickel. A patent model scarificator dating
from 1851 was found to contain about 63% copper, 24% zinc, and 13% nickel.
This alloy is presently called &#8220;nickel-silver 65-12&#8221; alloy. The French
made scarificators out of their own version of nickel-silver that was
called &#8220;maillechort.&#8221; The French circular scarificator was found to
contain copper (55%-70%), nickel (10%-20%), zinc (20%-30%), and tin (less
than 10%). The cases in which the lancets and scarificators were carried
were covered with leather, despite the fact that several appeared to be
covered with paper. X-ray analysis revealed that several cases contained
tin, leading to the possibility that a tin salt was used in the
dye-mordant for leather. The clasps on the cases were made of brass. One
case was trimmed in gold leaf.</p>

<p>The most difficult item to analyze was the pen and ink drawing in black
and red of a bloodletting man purported to be a fifteenth-century specimen
(1480) from South Germany. The text is in German (Figure <a href="#fig25">25</a>).</p>

<p>The watermark of the paper&mdash;a horned bull (ox) with crown&mdash;is believed to
have appeared in 1310 and was used widely for two hundred years. The paper
was heavily sized and no feathering of the black ink or red paint appears.</p>

<p>The paper fluoresced only faintly under ultraviolet light and much less
brightly than new paper, leading to the conclusion that the paper is not
modern. Various stains on the paper fluoresce yellow, which also indicates
a considerable history for the document.</p>

<p>The guard strip is vellum. Red stains on this strip may have been made by
blood.</p>

<p>The inks (brown and red) may have come from different sources or been
applied at different times because of their various compositions and
densities. Iron and lead were found in an area of writing on the left
foot. Iron is typical of an iron gall ink. Some of the lighter lines
contain graphite. The red lines contain mercury and lead suggesting a
mixture of vermilion and red lead.</p>

<p>Analysis of the ink and paper indicates that the document has had a varied
history and seems not to have been a deliberate production intended to
simulate age.</p>

<h3>Catalog of Bloodletting Instruments</h3>

<p>Several systems of catalog numbers have been employed for instruments in
the collections. The earliest instruments were originally collected by the
Division of Anthropology and were given a six-digit number in the division
catalog (referred to as &#8220;Anthropology&#8221;). Later objects in the collections
have been given a six-digit National Museum of History and Technology
(NMHT) accession number, which serves for all items obtained from one
source at a given date. Before 1973, the Division of Medical Sciences used
a system of numbering individual items by M numbers (e.g., &#8220;M-4151&#8221;).
Since 1973, individual items have been distinguished by adding decimal
numbers to the accession numbers (e.g., &#8220;308730.10&#8221;). Objects on loan have
been marked as such and given a six-digit number. Other institutional
abbreviations are as follows: SI = Smithsonian Institution; USNM = the
former United States National Museum; NLM = National Library of Medicine.</p>

<p class="hang">Spring lancet, patent model, 1849. Lancet is brass and oval shaped. A
wheel and axle mechanism allows the blade to sweep out an elliptical
curve. Lancet is set by a detachable key and released by a lever
protruding from the side. Lever is missing or hidden inside the case and
the mechanism is frozen. Patented in 1849 by Joseph Ives of Bristol,
Connecticut (U.S. patent 6240). Transferred from the U.S. Patent Office
1926. L 97 mm, W 33 mm, H 14 mm. Neg. 73-4211 (BW, CS). NMHT 89797
(M-4292). (Figure <a href="#fig23">23</a>.)</p>

<p class="hang">Spring lancet, patent model, 1880. Instrument is made of brass and shaped
like a gun. The cocking lever is attached to both a coiled spring in the
handle of the gun and an extension of the blade. Pushing the trigger
injects the blade. Blade is dart form with double beveled edges, as was
typical of veterinary fleams. Patented by Hermann Reinhold and August
Schreiber of Davenport, Iowa (U.S. patent 236084). Transferred from the
U.S. Patent Office 1926. L 105 mm (to tip of blade), H 77 mm. Neg. 73-4210

<p class="hang">Spring lancet with case, 19th century. Brass knob end lancet, a larger
version of the spring lancet used in human phlebotomy. Case is also
similar to the spring lancet cases for human use. It is made of wood
covered with brown leather, lined with chamois, and closed by a latch.
Case has a chalice decoration on top. Donated by Dr. A. J. Olmstead 1945.

<p class="hang">Spring lancet, 19th century. Veterinary lancet similar to the previous
lancet except that the blade is larger and provided with a blade guard.
Blade guard can be set by a screw in order to regulate the size of the
blade. Stamped on back panel is &#8220;F. Leypoldt/Phila.&#8221; This is presumably
the same Frederick Leypoldt who patented two scarificators, one in 1847
and one in 1851. Donated by the University of Pennsylvania 1959. L 74 mm,

<p class="hang">Spring lancet with case, 19th century. Instrument is made of brass and has
a ball-shaped handle. The blade is double beveled, typical of blades for
veterinary bleeders. The ball handle contains a spring that is attached to
a small projecting cylinder with string tied to it. By pulling on the
string, one can pull the blade in, and by pushing a button one can inject
the blade. Case is made of wood covered with leather and is coffin-shaped.
Purchased 1976. L 95 mm (to tip of blade), D of ball 34 mm. Neg. 76-7750
(BW, CS). NMHT 321697.07. (Figure <a href="#fig104">104</a>.)</p>

<p class="hang">Spring lancet with case, 19th century. Lancet is brass and has a
triangular shape. It is triggered by a slide catch on the front of the
instrument. The triggering handle is a detachable piece that lifts off a
square peg. Hinged from the side is a curved piece for ease in holding.
Screw on front of the instrument probably regulates blade depth and a
rectangular button at the top corner probably releases the blade.
Mechanism is jammed and the blade is hidden within the instrument. Only
the bottom half of the case remains. Purchase 1976. L 83 mm, W 59 mm. Neg.

attached to an iron lever, which, when pulled back, is held in place by a
lever with ratchets attached to the facing side of the instrument.
Pressing upon this same lever releases the ratchets and injects the blade.
Purchased 1976. H 97 mm, W 80 mm. Neg. 76-7755 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.09.

<p class="hang">Spring lancet with case, 18th century. This rather elegant lancet consists
of a body and a detachable handle. According to analysis by the
Conservation Laboratory, the lancet is made of ferrous metal (iron or
steel). Blade is screwed into a curved lever. Pulling upon the handle
pulls back the lever with the blade, and releasing the handle releases the
blade. Case is made of wood, covered with black leather and lined with
green silk and green plush. Seller says that the lancet was made in
England, ca. 1700. This date seems somewhat too early. Purchased 1976. H
112 mm, W 72 mm (to tip of blade). Neg. 76-7753 (BW, CS). NMHT 321697.10.

along the blade by a screw attached directly opposite the blade. It fits
into a red leather case with beige velvet lining. The case closes with two
brass hooks. Purchased 1976. Case: L 92 mm, W 75 mm. Height without lever
66 mm, Width at widest point 64 mm, overall width 12 mm. Neg. 77-13961

<p class="hang">Counter-irritation device, patent model, 1860. Improved version of
Baunscheidt&#8217;s <i>Lebenswecker</i> patented by Alfred Stauch of Philadelphia
(U.S. patent no. 28697). Stauch added a brush around the needles and an
additional spring to force the needles back after they had entered the
skin. The brush could be oiled before the operation, thus saving the need
to oil the wound afterwards. The device is similar to the <i>Lebenswecker</i>
in size and construction, except that it was made of a lighter colored
wood and was trimmed in brass. Transferred from the U.S. Patent Office
1926. L 245 mm, D 20 mm. Neg. 72-11290 (BW). NMHT 89797 (M-4299).</p>

<p class="hang">Counter-irritation device, patent model, 1866. Patented by Friederich Klee
of Williamsburg, New York (U.S. Patent 55775), this instrument is another
modification of Baunscheidt&#8217;s <i>Lebenswecker</i>. It is made of wood and
brass, and is much shorter than the <i>Lebenswecker</i> but operated in the
same manner. A screw on the handle served to regulate the length of the
needles. A further innovation was the addition of a diaphragm of leather
through which the needles pass. The leather could be saturated with oil
before the operation, thus again saving the need to apply oil afterwards.

claimed Fuller had pirated from him. The only difference between Weiss&#8217;s

sharper cut. In any case, most nineteenth-century scarificators were made
with crescent-shaped blades. On Fuller&#8217;s scarificator, see <span class="smcap">Bayfield</span>, op.

the application of a red-hot iron to the skin. A seton was a long strip of

<p><a name="f176" id="f176" href="#f176.1">[176]</a> Broussais offered the following explanation for the effectiveness of
leeching. Congestion of blood vessels in a healthy person gives rise to a
sympathetic irritation in the mucous surfaces of bodily orifices.
Equilibrium may be restored naturally by hemorrhage through the nose.
Without this release of blood, congestion builds up into an inflammation.
Local bloodletting relieves the congestion when applied on a portion of
the skin corresponding to the inflamed organ. Broussais&#8217;s favorite remedy
was the application of leeches to the stomach and head. For this purpose
he ordered hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> of leeches daily. See <span class="smcap">F.J.V. Broussais</span>, <i>A Treatise

described the Indian method of bloodletting as follows: &#8220;The patient is
seated on a stone in the river, and one with a small bow shoots little
arrows into the naked body of the patient, up and down, shooting them as
fast as he can and not missing any part. But the arrows are guarded, so
that they penetrate no farther than we commonly thrust our lancets; and if
by chance they hit a vein which is full of wind, and the blood spurts out
a little, they will leap and skip about, shewing many antic gestures, by
way of rejoicing and triumph.&#8221; (From Lionel Wepfer, <i>A New Voyage and

<h2>REQUIREMENTS FOR SMITHSONIAN SERIES PUBLICATION</h2>

<p><b>Manuscripts</b> intended for series publication receive substantive review
within their originating Smithsonian museums or offices and are submitted
to the Smithsonian Institution Press with approval of the appropriate
museum authority on Form SI-36. Requests for special treatment&mdash;use of
color, foldouts, casebound covers, etc.&mdash;require, on the same form, the
added approval of designated committees or museum directors.</p>

<p><b>Review</b> of manuscripts and art by the Press for requirements of series
format and style, completeness and clarity of copy, and arrangement of all
material, as outlined below, will govern, within the judgment of the
Press, acceptance or rejection of the manuscripts and art.</p>

<p><b>Copy</b> must be typewritten, double-spaced, on one side of standard white
bond paper, with 1&#188;&#8243; margins, submitted as ribbon copy (not carbon or
xerox), in loose sheets (not stapled or bound), and accompanied by
original art. Minimum acceptable length is 30 pages.</p>

<p>Front matter (preceding the text) should include: <b>title page</b> with only
title and author and no other information, <b>abstract page</b> with
author/title/series/etc., following the established format, <b>table of
contents</b> with indents reflecting the heads and structure of the paper.</p>

<p><b>First page of text</b> should carry the title and author at the top of the
page and an unnumbered footnote at the bottom consisting of author&#8217;s name
and professional mailing address.</p>

<p><b>Center heads</b> of whatever level should be typed with initial caps of major
words, with extra space above and below the head, but with no other
preparation (such as all caps or underline). Run-in paragraph heads should
use period/dashes or colons as necessary.</p>

<p><b>Tabulations</b> within text (lists of data, often in parallel columns) can be
typed on the text page where they occur, but they should not contain rules
or formal, numbered table heads.</p>

<p><b>Formal tables</b> (numbered, with table heads, boxheads, stubs, rules) should
be submitted as camera copy, but the author must contact the series
section of the Press for editorial attention and preparation assistance
before final typing of this matter.</p>

<p><b>Taxonomic keys</b> in natural history papers should use the alined-couplet
form in the zoology and paleobiology series and the multi-level indent
form in the botany series. If cross-referencing is required between key
and text, do not include page references within the key, but number the
keyed-out taxa with their corresponding heads in the text.</p>

<p><b>Synonymy</b> in the zoology and paleobiology series must use the short form
(taxon, author, year:page), with a full reference at the end of the paper
under &#8220;Literature Cited.&#8221; For the botany series, the long form (taxon,
author, abbreviated journal or book title, volume, page, year, with no
reference in the &#8220;Literature Cited&#8221;) is optional.</p>

<p><b>Footnotes</b>, when few in number, whether annotative or bibliographic, should
be typed at the bottom of the text page on which the reference occurs.
Extensive notes must appear at the end of the text in a notes section. If
bibliographic footnotes are required, use the short form (author/brief
title/page) with the full reference in the bibliography.</p>

<p><b>Text-reference system</b> (author/year/page within the text, with the full
reference in a &#8220;Literature Cited&#8221; at the end of the text) must be used in
place of bibliographic footnotes in all scientific series and is strongly
recommended in the history and technology series: &#8220;(Jones, 1910:122)&#8221; or
&#8220;... Jones (1910:122).&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Bibliography</b>, depending upon use, is termed &#8220;References,&#8221; &#8220;Selected
References,&#8221; or &#8220;Literature Cited.&#8221; Spell out book, journal, and article
titles, using initial caps in all major words. For capitalization of
titles in foreign languages, follow the national practice of each
language. Underline (for italics) book and journal titles. Use the
colon-parentheses system for volume/number/page citations: &#8220;10(2):5-9.&#8221;
For alinement and arrangement of elements, follow the format of the series
for which the manuscript is intended.</p>

<p><b>Legends</b> for illustrations must not be attached to the art nor included
within the text but must be submitted at the end of the manuscript&mdash;with
as many legends typed, double-spaced, to a page as convenient.</p>

<p><b>Illustrations</b> must not be included within the manuscript but must be
submitted separately as original art (not copies). All illustrations
(photographs, line drawings, maps, etc.) can be intermixed throughout the
printed text. They should be termed <b>Figures</b> and should be numbered
consecutively. If several &#8220;figures&#8221; are treated as components of a single
larger figure, they should be designated by lowercase italic letters
(underlined in copy) on the illustration, in the legend, and in text
references: &#8220;Figure 9<span class="u">b</span>.&#8221; If illustrations are intended to be printed
separately on coated stock following the text, they should be termed
<b>Plates</b> and any components should be lettered as in figures: &#8220;Plate 9<span class="u">b</span>.&#8221;
Keys to any symbols within an illustration should appear on the art and
not in the legend.</p>

<p><b>A few points of style</b>: (1) Do not use periods after such abbreviations as
&#8220;mm, ft, yds, USNM, NNE, AM, BC.&#8221; (2) Use hyphens in spelled-out
fractions: &#8220;two-thirds.&#8221; (3) Spell out numbers &#8220;one&#8221; through &#8220;nine&#8221; in
expository text, but use numerals in all other cases if possible. (4) Use
the metric system of measurement, where possible, instead of the English
system. (5) Use the decimal system, where possible, in place of fractions.
(6) Use day/month/year sequence for dates: &#8220;9 April 1976.&#8221; (7) For months
in tabular listings or data sections, use three-letter abbreviations with
no periods: &#8220;Jan, Mar, Jun,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p><b>Arrange and paginate sequentially EVERY sheet of manuscript</b>&mdash;including ALL
front matter and ALL legends, etc., at the back of the text&mdash;in the
following order: (1) title page, (2) abstract, (3) table of contents, (4)
foreword and/or preface, (5) text, (6) appendixes, (7) notes, (8)
glossary, (9) bibliography, (10) index, (11) legends.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes:</b></p>

<p>Images have been moved from the middle of a paragraph to the closest paragraph break. Thus, page numbering around
the images within the text does not exactly match the original.</p>

<p>The text in the Table of Contents is presented as in the original text, but the links
navigate to the page number closest to the item&#8217;s loaction in this document.</p>

<p>Punctuation has been corrected without note.</p>

<p>Other than the corrections noted by hover information, printer&#8217;s
inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation have been retained.</p>
